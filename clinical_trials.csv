cell senescence,senescence aging,NCT06142890,Efficacy of Ceiling Fans for Mitigating Thermal Strain During Bed Rest in Older Adults During Heat Waves,COMPLETED,,"With the increasing regularity and intensity of hot weather and heat waves, there is an urgent need to develop heat-alleviation strategies able to provide targeted protection for heat-vulnerable older adults. While air-conditioning provides the most effective protection from extreme heat, it is inaccessible for many individuals. Air-conditioning is also energy intensive, which can strain the electrical grid and, depending on the source of electricity generation, contribute to green house gas emissions. For these reasons, recent guidance has recommended the use of electric fans as a sustainable cooling alternative. While fans may increase sweat evaporation and heat loss in healthy, young adults, evidence supporting their use in older adults is scarce. Further, studies show that when environmental temperature exceeds skin temperature, fans are not effective and can even exacerbate hyperthermia in older adults. While older adults only account for \~13% of the population, they account for \~40% off all hospitalizations. In the context of sustainable cooling interventions, this is of particular importance given that many hospitals and long-term care homes do not have air-conditioning and rely on ceiling fans to enhance sweat evaporation while participants are bed-resting. While recent biophysical modelling has suggested that pedestal fans likely provide a clinically meaningful cooling effect (proposed to be ≥0.3°C) in temperatures below \~34°C in older adults, the efficacy of ceiling fans in mitigating heat strain in these conditions is currently unknown.

To address these knowledge gaps, this randomized crossover trial will evaluate body core temperature, cardiovascular strain, orthostatic intolerance, dehydration, and thermal comfort in adults aged 65-85 years exposed for 8-hours to conditions experienced during indoor overheating occurring during a heat wave in a temperate continental climate (31°C, 45% relative humidity). Each participant will complete two randomized exposures that will differ only in the airflow generated by a ceiling fan: no airflow (control) or standard airflow. Participants will remain in a supine position for the duration of the 8-hour exposure period, except for during hour 7 when they will complete a series of cardiovascular autonomic response tests.","Hyperthermia, Heat Stress, Cooling, Aging"

cell senescence,senescence aging,NCT02735005,Determining the Needs of Aging People With Disabilities,COMPLETED,,"Heterogeneous modalities of aging lead to describe three categories of elderly patients: 1-healthy without frailty, 2- healthy with frailty, 3- patients with chronic disease(s) and frailty. Frail people have a high risk of losing functional independence and as a consequence they require more help for day to day life. It is known in elderly that physical activities, nutrition, social environment are important to maintain functional independence.

For patients with disabilities, less is known about the occurence of dependance with aging. That is of growing importance because life expectancy of disabled patients has increased a lot during last decades, and because caregivers, often parents, also become elderly and frail.

So the investigators will require tools to anticipate prevention and supportive needs for this specific population.

The goal of this study is to evaluate if the participants (disabled patients over 40 years old) of a well-defined region in the south-east of France (400000 inhabitants), and to assess their needs, using the Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF) developed for assessment of the elderly, by Rejean Hebert \& Nicole Dubuc's team in Sherbrooke University (Quebec/Canada).","Disabled People, Aging, Mental Handicap"

cell senescence,senescence longevity,NCT05455229,Elucidating How Physical Activity and Sleep Relate to Optimal Cognitive Ageing,COMPLETED,,"Increased longevity is one of the greatest success stories in public health. However, ageing is accompanied by cognitive decline which affects people's daily functioning and, if it develops to dementia, their ability to live independently. By 2050, the number of people who develop dementia will triple to 152 million. The aim of this project is to precisely examine how physical activity (PA) and sleep, both modifiable lifestyle factors, are related to cognitive function and which role they can play in optimal cognitive ageing. To do so, a longitudinal study will be conducted, with objective measures of PA, sleep and cognition in midlife and older adults. This project will meet the current need for longitudinal studies with objective PA and sleep data, as well as provide, for the first time, in-depth information on associations of type of PA (aerobic vs muscle strengthening), characteristics of sleep (quality vs quantity) with specific cognitive domains (executive function and memory). Furthermore, although PA and sleep are related, the behavioural dynamics of combinations of PA and sleep on cognition has never been studied before. To fill this gap, these relationships will be examined with an innovative statistical approach, looking at data across a 24-hour period. The resulting deeper understanding of the precise relationship between PA, sleep and cognitive function will contribute to the development of preventive interventions for maintaining cognitive health at older age.",Cognitive Aging
cell senescence,senescence longevity,NCT05500742,Anti-age Dietary Supplements in Healthy Older Adults: the proBNPage Reduction Trial,UNKNOWN,,"Background - The research on the possibilities to extend longevity in humans is presently based on large and long randomized longitudinal studies designed to compare all-cause mortality between treated and control groups. The availability of a simple and reliable marker of biological age might allow an acceleration of the research in this field, demonstrating in small samples and after limited periods of time, the ability of a given treatment to slow down, arrest or even revert the progression of biological age. Our previous studies suggest that this marker of biological age might be the N-terminal of B-type natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-proBNP), from which proBNPage, namely a biological age surrogate in years, can easily be calculated.

Objectives of the study - 1) To fine-tune the method of proBNPage assessment, i.e., to establish the minimum time required to detect a significant increase in proBNPage in a small group of subjects. This will be the duration of next studies to test possible ""anti-age"" treatments. 2) To assess the ability of 4 ""anti-age"" treatments, which provided promising results in previous experimental and human studies, to modify proBNPage progression.

Study design - Double-blind randomized clinical trial on a sample of healthy older adults stratified for age and sex.

Study description - One hundred and twenty healthy subjects (in particular, without previous or current cardiovascular diseases) aged 65-80 years of both sexes will be randomized into 3 groups: A) Coenzyme Q10 100 mg bid + Selenium 100 mcg; B) Resveratrol 350 mg bid + TA-65 MD 100 U; C) Placebo-1 bid + Placebo-2. All these subjects will be followed for 2 years and checked 8 times, to assess both proBNPage progression and the safety of the treatments. Handgrip strength, aerobic capacity at the step test and quality of life will also be assessed.

Statistical analysis - In the placebo group, the minimum time required to obtain a significant increase in proBNPage will be established by paired t tests. In the treated groups, possible differences in proBNPage progression with the curve obtained in the placebo group will be sought, both according to intention to treat and in the subjects that will complete the study, by repeated measures ANOVA.",Aging

Mostly, elderly population living in nursing homes suffers from dementia, Alzheimer, depression, agitation, and other diseases that require multidisciplinary treatment.

In addition to the medical and pharmacological treatments that patients receive to maintain functional medical status, there is a great need for non-pharmacological treatments, that may improve quality of life, mental well-being, and life satisfaction.

There are several treatment approaches of multisensory stimulation environment (MSSE). MSSE in the Snoezelen room therapy recognized as benefiting the patients' physical, mental, and emotional health status. In addition, there is great importance of intervention by social interaction, support, and encouragement.

However, the effect of combined intervention of MSSE in Snoezelen room therapy and social support, has not yet been sufficiently studied in elderly patients in nursing homes.

metabolism,metabolism aging,NCT04106882,Dynamic Connectivity Under Metabolic Constraints,UNKNOWN,PHASE4,"The investigators are studying the impact of insulin resistance on the acceleration of brain aging and testing whether increased neuron insulin resistance can be counteracted by utilization of alternate metabolic pathways (e.g., ketones rather than glucose). This study has three Arms, which together provide synergistic data. For all three Arms, subjects are tested in a within-subjects design that consists of 2-3 testing sessions, 1-14 days apart, and counter-balanced for order. Impact of fuel (glucose in one session, ketones in the other) on brain metabolism and associated functioning is measured during each session. For Arms 1-2, the primary experimental measure is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is used to trace the self-organization of functional networks following changes in energy supply and demand. Arm 1 tests the impact of endogenous ketones produced by switching to a low carbohydrate diet, while Arm 2 tests the impact of exogenous ketones consumed as a nutritional supplement. For Arm 3, simultaneous magnetic resonance spectroscopy/positron-emission tomography (MR/PET) is used to quantify the impact of exogenous ketones on production of glutamate and GABA, key neurotransmitters.

Subjects will be given the option to participate in more than one of the Arms, but doing so is not expected nor required.

Prior to scans, subjects will receive a clinician-administered History and Physical (H\&P), which includes vital signs, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and the comprehensive metabolic blood panel. These will be used to assess diabetes, kidney disease, and electrolytes. If subjects pass screening, they will be provided the option to participate in one or more Arms, which include neuroimaging. To provide a quantitative measure of time-varying metabolic activity throughout the scan, based upon quantitative models of glucose and ketone regulation, as well as to be able to implement safety stopping rules (see below), the investigators will obtain pin-prick blood samples three times: prior to the scan, following consumption of the glucose or ketone drink, and following completion of the scan. To assess effects of increased metabolic demand, the investigators measure brain response to cognitive load, transitioning from resting-state to spatial reasoning through a spatial navigation video task.

Aging is a gradual decline in cellular and organ functions, significantly increasing the risk of non-communicable and infectious diseases. Recent research has focused on identifying aging biomarkers that can better predict functional capability in healthy individuals. Biological age clocks, which can be measured from samples like blood or saliva, are emerging as valuable tools for assessing the pace of aging and calculating age acceleration-the difference between chronological and biological age.

These clocks utilize molecular and clinical data, including DNA methylation and plasma proteomics, to predict future health outcomes, such as disease risk and mortality. Various DNA methylation-based clocks have been developed, with the Dunedin Pace of Aging (PoAm) offering a more precise modeling of physiological changes over time. Lifestyle factors, including diet and physical activity, can influence age acceleration, suggesting that lifestyle interventions may impact biological aging.

Current evidence indicates that three specific epigenetic clocks-PhenoAge, GrimAge, and Dunedin PACE-are particularly effective in detecting beneficial effects on aging trajectories. However, the stability of these clocks during long-term lifestyle interventions remains unclear, as they can exhibit variability over short periods and may be affected by factors influenced by seasonal changes, such as Vitamin D levels, climate, and white blood cells composition.

With emphasis on understanding the mechanistic drivers of aging, it seeks translational approaches that could eventually be applied to improve human healthspan and delay age-associated chronic diseases. Contrary to popular opinion that aging is irreversible, advances in geroscience research have demonstrated that aging is modifiable and inhibiting or activating specific molecular pathways can improve healthspan and extend lifespan in model organisms. Advocates of geroscience take the view that age-related chronic diseases are best treated by slowing the aging process, rather than using the prevailing disease-centric approach of addressing each disease alone. Thus, the concept is that biological aging, rather than chronological aging, is amenable to intervention.

In this regard, geroscientists are at the forefront of longevity medicine in rigorously testing novel supplements, drugs and other prophylactics that can enhance healthspan. Some of these interventions involve repurposing existing drugs such as rapamycin, a well-known immunosuppressant, at different dosing regimens to specifically target biological hallmarks of aging.

epigenetic,epigenetic longevity,NCT00242255,Epigenetics in the Aging Process,COMPLETED,,"This study will examine the role of epigenetics (heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in DNA sequence) in the aging process. DNA is the primary genetic material, responsible for transmitting information from one cell to the next or from one generation to the next. A second layer of heredity is described by the term ""epigenetics.""

Epigenetic information is reset from one generation to the next. It works in two ways: 1) by modification of the DNA, like balloons stuck at irregular intervals onto the sides of the DNA helix that encodes genes, and 2) through specialized protein shells that wrap around some regions of DNA. As in DNA, these shells can copy themselves and can transmit instructions. Because they are used to turn genes on and off, errors in their settings cause critical misinformation to be transmitted.

Aging involves many changes, such as muscle weakening, graying hair, skin wrinkling, and so forth. There are several current theories of aging, including damage to genes by oxidation, shortening of tiny structures at the ends of chromosomes called telomeres, and the ability to stretch lifespan with caloric restrictions. This study will investigate the possible role of epigenetics in aging by examining and comparing the shell-like epigenetic settings in skin cells in young adults and older individuals. Preliminary results from earlier studies show differences in these settings in younger and older people.

As life expectancy has increased, the number of people with age-related cognitive impairment has also increased. The improvement or slowing of cognitive impairment has received more attention. Phosphatide is a naturally occurring Phosphatide, but it is the main acidic phospholipid in the brain. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid that regulates the function of key proteins in cell membranes and can improve brain function and repair brain damage. PS is thought to enhance neuronal membrane function, which in turn enhances cognitive function. However, there are few studies on the effect of PS on human cognitive function, especially on the elderly, and the results are inconsistent.

Older patients' cognitive and physical status is known to deteriorate after surgery, leading to a high 30-day mortality due to post-operative comorbidities. Aging and related diseases share immune-related pathomechanisms. During aging, a chronic, low-grade sterile inflammation, called inflamaging, gradually develops. This likely results from low-grade innate immune activation and a functional, epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming of immune cells. Based on the hypothesis that surgical trauma leads to misplaced or altered self-molecules, which exacerbate inflammation and the postoperative risk for morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. There is increasing evidence that the individual's pre-operative immunobiography determines the susceptibility to peri-operative inflammation and post-operative outcome. Current exploratory pilot study will thus perform phenotyping of patients above 80 years undergoing major surgery. Participants will be evaluated for acute and long-term outcomes, including all-cause mortality, physical and cognitive function. To assess the individual's immunobiography, participants will be characterised by inflammation biomarkers combined with immunophenotyping, functional assays, and (epi-) genomic analyses before and after surgery.

Older adults are a particularly vulnerable population as functional (vascular and skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction) and structural deficits (loss in muscle mass leading to a reduction in strength) are a consequence of the aging process. The combination of inactivity and aging poses an added health threat to these individuals by accelerating the negative impact on vascular and skeletal muscle function and dysfunction. The underlying factors leading to vascular and skeletal muscle dysfunction are unknown, but have been linked to increases in oxidative stress. Additionally, there is a lack of understanding of how vascular function is impacted by inactivity in humans and how these changes are related to skeletal muscle function.

The primary purpose of this registry is to measure biomarkers of aging/senescence and build computational models of aging in order to better understand the role of senescence in aging-related functional decline and differences between aging in a general population vs cohorts enriched for aging related disease (cancer, heart disease). Aging biomarker data in cohorts with cancer and heart disease has already been collected; the current study will enroll participants into the cohort of aging in the general population (Aging Cohort).

Over the past century, life expectancy has increased by 30 years. With that gain has come a dramatic rise in age-related disease and an urgent need to understand, prevent, and treat these conditions. While age-related diseases have diverse phenotypes, there is increasing recognition of common biological underpinnings with cellular senescence as the nexus linking subcellular changes due to epigenetic changes, DNA damage, and mitochondria dysfunction with a decline in health due to multi-morbidity. The molecular changes that shift one's aging trajectory from a 'healthy' state to a 'disease' state are poorly understood; however, there is increasing evidence that senescence plays a key role in this shift. Computational models of natural aging and aging related disease are important tools in understanding the phenomenon of senescence, its regulation and dynamics, and its role in physiological or pathological processes during human aging. These findings will serve as pilot data for future analysis of cellular senescence, as measured by p16INK4 (hereafter referred to as p16) expression, and aging in other cohorts and begin to establish comparisons between p16 and other potentially clinically relevant aging biomarkers such as DNA methylation and plasma proteomics.",Healthy Aging

These age-related chronic diseases are associated with diminished skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in humans. Nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) is a coenzyme that regulates mitochondrial function, therefore, plays an important role in energy metabolism. Importantly, it has been shown that high cellular NAD+ levels as well as a high NAD+/NADH ratio promote metabolic and mitochondrial health. In contrast, NAD+ bioavailability declines upon aging in humans as well as in animal models of metabolic disorders and type 2 diabetes. These findings fuel the notion of boosting the NAD+ bioavailability in order to improve metabolic disturbances and mitochondrial dysfunction in aged individuals. Supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR), a naturally occurring form of vitamin B3, boosts cellular NAD+ levels. However, in contrast to animal studies, NR supplementation in humans has so far been unsuccessful in improving skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, exercise capacity or insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, Recently, it has been suggested that metabolic conditions where NAD+ levels become limited, is needed for NR supplementation to exert beneficial health effects. This metabolic condition could be achieved by exercise. However, studies combining NR and exercise are lacking, and that is why we will perform the present study.","Healthy Aging, Lifestyle-related Condition, Metabolic Diseases"

Chronic solar UV exposure has multiple damaging effects on skin, such as wrinkling, dryness, dyspigmentation, epidermal thinning and increasing fragility. In addition, solar exposure and age increase a subepidermal band.

Fibrillar collagen, which is synthesized from fibroblasts, is the predominant extracellular matrix (ECM) component of the dermis. Collagen type I and III are considered to be the major interstitial, fiber forming collagen in normal human dermis. In addition, the dermis contains collagen types IV (gelatine), V and VI. Other important component of the EMC of the dermis are elastic fibers being elastin (ELN) their main component and play a critical role in skin elasticity and the reduction of elastic fiber production results in impaired elasticity. UV radiation induces ECM degeneration and consequently an increase in fragility and loss of elasticity of the skin. This process is mediated by an increase in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression in human skin which are responsible for degrading ECM proteins, such as collagen, fibronectin and elastin.

Aortic stenosis increases left ventricular pressure overload. Cardiac deposits have been observed in AS and the amount of these deposits has been correlated to post-surgical outcome. As they are strong echocardiographic and cardiac MRI imaging similarities between CA and AS, the investigators hypothesized that the deposit observed in AS is transthyretin amyloid deposit. The investigators objective is to demonstrate that amyloid deposit is associated with poor outcomes following aortic stenosis surgical valve replacement.

Materiel and methods: 180 patients with indication for surgical aortic valve replacement will be recruited prospectively and consecutively in 5 French centers. A replicative study will be performed in one Austrian center. Echocardiography, cardiac MRI and bone scintigraphy will be performed prior to surgery. During surgery, a basal LV septum biopsy will be collected for determination and quantification of interstitial deposits using specific staining which will be performed in a blind fashion. Clinical outcomes will be recorded during the hospitalization period following the surgery and at 1 year. Alive and re-hospitalization status will be determined. Patients will be classified according to the presence or not of amyloid deposits.

Expected results and impact: This study will emphasize how pressure overload stress accelerates and magnifies amyloid deposition usually known to be related to cardiac aging process. It will develop reliable imaging tools and markers to detect cardiac amyloid deposition. Correlation between anatomopathologic analyses and the three different imaging technics will identify accurate imaging markers of CA.

autophagy,autophagy aging,NCT02472340,Mitophagy and Autophagy in Elderly Subjects,COMPLETED,,"In recent years, evidence has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the development of age-related muscle decline that may lead to frailty.

During aging, there is a progressive reduction in the cell's capacity to eliminate its dysfunctional elements by autophagy, as evidenced by the accumulation of oxidative damage and mutations in mitochondria and by the decrease in autophagic flux. In fact, it has been demonstrated that dysfunctional mitochondria can be specifically targeted for elimination by autophagy, a process that has been termed mitophagy.

A major challenge in the clinic today is in the lack of validated tools, including biomarkers, to assess the decline in mitochondrial health associated with an impairment in muscle function. In the present study, the investigators will employ a battery of established and exploratory tests (clinical, physiological and molecular) to assess in vivo mitochondrial function and more specifically, the levels of mitophagy and autophagy, in the muscle of healthy and pre-frail elderly.

It is anticipated that the results of this study will facilitate the rapid translation of interventions targeting mitophagy and autophagy for the improvement of muscle function.","Aging, Frailty, Mitophagy"

cell senescence,senescence aging,NCT05307666,MinMed: Do Older Adults do Better With Less Medication,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,PHASE4,"Many health care providers believe ""less-is-more"" for older adults, and evidence suggests minimizing certain medications might improve health outcomes. While this evidence focuses on specific medications believed potentially problematic for seniors, it is really adverse reactions to COMMON medications (e.g. medications lowering blood sugar or treating pain) that bring older adults to emergency departments.

Knowing recommended drug doses are lower in seniors, and knowing most adverse drug reactions are dose-related, the investigators are organizing primary care providers (family physicians and nurse practitioners) to invite their patients 80 years and older on 6 or more medications to review with them whether some medications could be safely reduced.

For drugs treating a symptom (e.g. heartburn), patients and providers will work together to find the lowest dose that provides the same benefit. For drugs that lower blood pressure or blood sugar, doses will be adjusted to keep blood pressure and blood sugar in the upper end of the target range, a range many providers feel to be safer for older adults.

Each provider will invite half their eligible patients to a minimization visit at the start of the study, and invite the other half later - after the health effects of minimizing the early group's medications is assessed. To do this, investigators will compare early minimizers to those whose medicines have not yet changed using electronic health data routinely collected on all Albertans. We hypothesize that minimizing medications will prolong independence, reduce mortality and hospitalization, and improve quality of life.

It is important to recognize that the intervention (reviewing all medications and determining the lowest effective doses) is already widely recommended as best practice when prescribing for older adults.

cell senescence,senescence aging,NCT07122427,Aging of the Vascular Wall,RECRUITING,,"Demographic aging is predicted to be one of the most significant social changes of the 21st century. Aging is a slow, multifactorial process that progressively impacts the integrity of cells, tissues, and organs. This decline in function increases the risk of numerous diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). CVD, the leading global cause of death, becomes more prevalent with age. Aging contributes to endothelial dysfunction, vessel stiffness, thickening, and impaired platelet function. These changes disrupt hemostatic processes and increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. Despite preventive strategies CVD remain a major public health challenge. Cellular aging, or senescence, affects all cell types, particularly endothelial cells and platelets. However, little research has compared the aging rates of different blood vessel types, such as arteries and veins. Given their distinct compositions and developmental origins, it is likely that their aging processes differ at molecular, cellular, and physiological levels.","Vascular Risk, Aging Disorder"

Background Sleep disorders in elderly individuals can negatively affect their comfort and quality of life. Due to its relaxing effect, music can be used as a supportive intervention in nursing care to improve sleep quality and comfort.

Methods

This study was conducted between January and April 2023 in the internal medicine department of a hospital in İzmir, Turkey. Patients aged 65 and older were divided into two groups using simple and stratified randomization:

Music group: Listened to MusiCure® compositions for 30 minutes, three times a week, for one week.

Control group: Received no intervention. Data Collection Process

Data were collected face-to-face on the first and fourth days. The following scales were used:

Richard Campbell Sleep Scale (to assess sleep quality) Short Form of the General Comfort Scale (to measure physical, psychological, and environmental comfort) Key Points Music intervention may positively affect sleep parameters such as sleep duration, sleep onset latency, and nighttime awakenings.

Music can increase psychological and physical relaxation, enhancing comfort levels in elderly individuals.

Considering individual music preferences may improve the effectiveness of the intervention.

Ethical Principles and Approvals The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of İzmir Bakırçay University and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.

This research aims to support the use of music interventions in nursing care and contribute to evidence-based practices to enhance sleep quality and comfort levels in elderly individuals.","Complementary and Alternative Therapies, Aging, Geriatric, Sleep Disorder in Elderly"

The marked increase in this segment of the population poses numerous practical and ethical questions regarding adaptation to our society, particularly in terms of medico-social offers. More specifically, surveys carried out among French people show an important paradox: almost 90% of those questioned want to be able to age in their home, but at the same time only a small part (estimated at 6%) of the French homes is adapted to the aging of its population. This inconsistency places the question of housing at the center of current public policies.

If current societal concerns raise the question of need to find alternatives to entering an institution, a research work addressing all dimensions impacted by life at home for the elderly (quality of life, maintenance of functional, decision-making skills, nutritional status, etc.) jointly in the same population area and at different times (i.e., until leaving home for some people) remains to be carried out to allow us to better understand the nature and functioning of these factors, and thus propose integrated models. Indeed, too often these questions are studied separately on different populations and at different stages different from the life of the elderly person. Unfortunately, this does not allow us to clearly perceive the importance specificity takes on each factor, nor whether the proposals made really meet the objectives assigned to them. These questions relate in particular to: what aspects related to the person or their environment they contribute, when the person wishes, to be able to stay and live in your home? Since the departure of domicile would be postponed, does this mean that it is carried out due to the state health of the elderly worse? Understanding the relationship between the elderly and their housing will make it possible to draw up an inventory of the premises necessary for construction of the steps which will follow and which will be carried out by the different partners, in particular the public authorities, associations, social landlords (e.g., implementation of new clinical studies, health promotion, policy support, urban and housing planning, etc.). As part of an action-research program (concrete actions and transformative in the field), and relying on the approaches already underway, the main objective of this project will be to determine in elderly people living at home independent what are the main intrinsic factors and extrinsic elements that allow/promote this way of life.","Aging, Functional Disturbance, Home"

We will continue to develop a reliable, fMRI protocol that investigates the activity of the motor cortical networks of selected trunk muscles (specific aim 1). We will also continue the development a reliable muscle functional MRI (mfMRI) protocol to assess the spatial muscle activation patterns of the deeper lumbopelvic muscles (specific aim 2). We will examine the test-retest reliability of these approaches in four distinct target populations: healthy adults, adults with chronic low back pain, older adults, and older adults with high levels of trunk muscle control (i.e., individuals with expertise in Pilates). By enrolling groups of various levels of trunk muscle control, pathology state and age, we will be able to not only determine the intra-individual reliability, but also the inter-individual reliability as we expect the variability of the measures to be influenced by physical ability, pain state and age. Lastly, in an exploratory aim we will examine the association of our novel neurophysiological measures from Aim 1 and 2 with classic biomechanical and muscle function measures (e.g., trunk extensor strength and trunk extensor steadiness). Successfully developing reliable techniques of this nature will result in new and improved research tools for conducting rigorous studies of therapeutic approaches, such as spinal manipulation and yoga, within the context of trunk muscle control and function.","Low Back Pain, Aging"

The investigators describe a study protocol designed to test the hypothesis that stimulation of the ear (where the vagus nerve can be safely stimulated) may improve exercise performance alongside beneficial changes in vagus nerve activity in human volunteers.

Methods. 28 healthy participants aged 18-75y will be randomly allocated to electrical ear stimulation or placebo treatment for 30 minutes at the same time of day, for 7 consecutive days. Heart monitoring, exercise bike testing, a simple sit-to-stand test and blood sampling will be performed immediately before the first day's intervention and after the last day's intervention. Participants and investigators will be masked to the treatment allocations and analyses. After a 14-day break, participants will perform the same protocol for the opposite intervention to their first treatment allocation. The primary outcome will be the change in VO2Peak (the best measure of exercise performance) following stimulation or placebo protocol. Secondary outcomes include reduction in heart rate after ending the exercise bike test, reduction from peak heart rate after standing from sitting, beat-to-beat heart rate measures and blood inflammatory marker levels.

Before participating, please read the following information carefully to understand the study's procedures. After reading, if you agree to join, you will be asked to complete some questionnaires and simple mobility tests.

BACKGROUND Programs that promote health, physical activity, social interaction, and mental stimulation are becoming more important for older adults. However, there is no clear way to measure their effectiveness.

Researchers from McGill, Exeter, Erasmus, and UT Health San Antonio universities are working together to better understand active aging. In earlier studies, over 200 people were interviewed to learn how older adults perceive active living. This study now aims to examine the physical and psychological functions associated with active living.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This project aims to test the reliability of the HRQL-OPAL scale and assess the level of physical and psychological function related to active aging.

STUDY PROCEDURES This research is conducted under the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Marmara University.

If you agree to participate:

You will first complete questionnaires (approx. 20 minutes).

Then, you will perform mobility tests (approx. 20 minutes) such as walking and changing positions. A small sensor will be placed on your shoe to measure your steps and movements.

You will not be asked to do anything unsafe or difficult, like jumping or standing on one leg.

If you agree, you may be asked to complete the HRQL-OPAL scale again two weeks later.

DURATION Total time for the first session is about 40 minutes. A second session, if agreed, will take about 20 minutes after two weeks.

BENEFITS You may not receive direct personal benefit, but the results may help improve scientific knowledge and support better ways to measure quality of life in older adults.

cell senescence,senescence aging,NCT05362214,Effects of Different Guiding Strategies on Biomechanics of Human Movement.,COMPLETED,,"With regards to the increase in the aging population globally, how to build up a successfully aging society has become the main issue in health care and socioeconomic. In addition, living with high physical function is one of the main goals and solutions, and exercising regularly is a direct and obvious way to achieve this goal. However, being elderly, it might not be easy for them to practice or do exercise every day due to some of their limitations such as learning difficulty and lack of motivation.

Nowadays, there are many different types of exercise supporting tools, which are in terms of visual or auditory cues, including two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) cues. Accordingly, several studies mentioned the positive outcomes of using a 3D visual cue compared with using the 2D one. Also, a study found that combining visual and auditory cues together resulted in a better perception than using either one alone.

Coupled with a coming of a small flyable robot so-called ""drone"", which can be programmed to fly autonomously in a 3D space, a few research teams applied it in many interactive applications with humans such as sports education relating for example dancing and boxing. Moreover, there was a research team that explored the interaction between a human and a drone in a close-range design by controlling the drone using both hands movement, which was inspired by Tai Chi martial art exercise. As a result, they found important findings of the calming and focusing experience of the participants due to the low level of constant propeller noise of the drone.

Regarding this, the investigators assumed that applying a drone, which can be recognized as a 3D visual cue, to a kind of exercise may provide some benefits in terms of physical health. In addition, the investigators applied it to a simple Chinese martial art exercise called ""Baduanjin Qigong"" since it was recommended for everyone, especially for the elderly because of its low requirement for physical and cognitive abilities.

However, based on our findings, there is no published information about the effects of the drone as a visual cue or exercise guiding tool in terms of biomechanical effects of human motion. Therefore, these effects would be observed throughout this study.

Besides, the investigators hypothesized that exercising with the drone, which is a 3D visual cue in this study, could provide a significant difference in biomechanics effects such as the center of pressure (COP) and smoothness of the arm when compared with using a 2D visual cue like video, or no visual cue like the audio illustration.

Given the high cost of geriatric care, a critical research issue is exploring ways to improve or maintain cognitive and functional status in old age. Unfortunately, it has been shown that training those specific cognitive processes most sensitive to ageing (such as speed of processing or working memory), produces only limited beneficial effects. However, research also suggests that factors such as cognitive engagement, physical activity and social context may act as more general modulators of cognitive decline. This project is a longitudinal study with experimental and control groups. It is inspired from the engagement model of cognitive optimization suggesting that a lifestyle marked by social and intellectual engagement may mitigate age-related declines on cognitive functioning. It uses new cutting-edge information computing technology (ICT) solutions to improve or simply maintain cognitive functions in the elderly. This research investigates how the treatment reduces the effects of cognitive age-related decline in executive control processes and episodic (explicit) memory using behavioral and imaging measures. The results will provide significant knowledge on the potential of new ICT technologies to delay, compensate, and even prevent common chronic problems experienced by the elderly population. The hypothesis is that cognitive training with video-games through ICT solutions will promote brain and mental health and independence.

Health agencies including the World Health Organization, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Health Canada currently recommend visiting a cooling centre or other air-conditioned location for 1-3 hours per day during extreme heat events to mitigate hyperthermia and strain on the cardiovascular system and therefore the risk adverse health events. However, our recent trial shows that while brief air-conditioning exposure is effective for reducing body temperature and cardiovascular burden in healthy older adults, the physiological impacts of cooling abate quickly following return to the heat. The purpose of this project is therefore to assess whether shorter but more frequent air-conditioning exposure provides more effective cooling than current recommendations (a single 1-3-hour cooling bout) in older adults with or without common chronic health conditions associated with increased vulnerability to extreme heat. This will be accomplished by evaluating physiological strain in older adults with and without diabetes and/or hypertension exposed for 8 hours to conditions reflective of extreme heat events in temperate, continental climates (35°C, 60% relative humidity).

cell senescence,senescence aging,NCT04061785,Impact of Skills Acquired Through Judo Training on Risk Factors for Falling in Elderly Men and Women,COMPLETED,,"Falls and injuries from falls are one of the greatest threats to public health. One of the risk factors for accidental falls is a low self-efficacy regarding the perceived capability to perform activities without the risk of falling. Judo is a sport which include ""break fall"" strategies where falls with correct landing strategies and rolling movements are in focus in order to avoid injuries. The investigators expect that a judo inspired training (Judo4Balance) will strengthen self-efficacy when it comes to the perceived ability to perform daily tasks without the risk of falling and thereby reduce the risk for falling. Judo based training also includes a well rounded training with focus on strength, balance, explosive power, stamina, proprioception and flexibility. These physical qualities are of importance for reducing the risk of falling. Therefore the investigators' hypothesis is that a 12 week long judo inspired training program could be a suitable tool for reducing falls.

The aim of the project is to evaluate and document whether a 12 week standardized judo inspired exercise program including both the training of above mentioned physical qualities as well as ""break fall"" techniques can influence the risk of falling as well as reduce the negative consequences such as injuries from an accidental fall.

For the evaluation of the 12 week intervention a validated test battery will be used which gives an indication of the risk for falling in the near future. Furthermore, a specifically designed ""Falling Competence"" Test has been developed by the investigators' M. Tonoknogi and K Strömqvist Bååthe to measure ""break fall"" technique.

If it can be proven that the intervention group reaches the expected positive results then the control group will be offered the same type of Judo4Balance training after that they have been participating as a randomized control group.

There is evidence that the risk of falling can be reduced by training, nevertheless judo based training has not to the investigator's knowledge been scientifically investigated among the elderly with the aim of reducing the risk of falls. Neither has it been studied if this type of group training is motivational for continuing physical activity after the intervention.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the Swedish Govt. recommendations (in mid March 2020) to avoid group exercises for older adults (to decrease the risk of the spread of Covid-19) the 9 exercise intervention groups where put on hold/paused after 6-9 weeks into the exercise program.

Our long range goal is to determine whether other hormones (e.g., combined testosterone and growth hormone) are helpful as an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy.

This project is important to the VA health care system because 38% of American veterans are aged (age \> 65 years), bioavailable testosterone is diminished in older age men, low testosterone is associated with impaired muscle strength, and lack of muscle strength hinders rehabilitation. Older men who are not successfully rehabilitated often get admitted to nursing homes for long term care, at a cost of approximately $40,000/year. Payment for long term care is currently one of our most difficult health care problems. If testosterone supplementation improves rehabilitation outcomes, as our pilot data suggest it will, patients will be more satisfied and long-term care financial resources will be saved.

We will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that supplementation with testosterone improves rehabilitation outcomes in deconditioned older men. Specifically, we will screen all hospitalized older men with delayed discharge from the hospital (\> 7 day hospital stay). Men who have at least one new impairment in their ability to perform activities of daily living (e.g., inability to walk), low serum testosterone concentration, and no contraindications (e.g., prostate or breast cancer) will be offered the opportunity to participate. Study participants will be randomized to receive either testosterone (5 mg transdermally each night) or placebo (matching transdermal patch) daily in a double-blind fashion for the duration of their hospital course (expected average duration of study is 29 days). Subjects will then receive their rehabilitation as usual, with all members of the health care team blinded as to whether the subject is receiving testosterone or placebo. At baseline, weekly, at discharge, and at 6 and 12 months after discharge, subjects will be assessed using validated measures (i.e., Functional Independence Measure - FIM).

cell senescence,senescence aging,NCT03552042,Ageing as a Mindset: A Counterclockwise Experiment to Rejuvenate Older Adults,COMPLETED,,"Ageing is generally perceived as a biologically-determined process. There is growing literature, however, that discusses the role of psychological factors in the ageing process. In particular, age-related stereotypes, which reflect the images that people have about the ageing process, seem to have a strong influence on health and life satisfaction, through self-fulfilling prophecy mechanisms. According to the stereotype embodiment theory, mindful changes in these images will promote a change in both the mind and the body, resulting, for example, in a rejuvenation and in a higher quality of life.

The project aims to investigate whether changes in mindsets (i.e., addressing one's age-related stereotypes) can change the ageing process. The psychological components of ageing, as well as how these could be reverted, will be investigated. In other words, the study aims to provide a first answer to the question: ""can the mind be used to become younger?"" To answer this question, the project will test the efficacy of an intervention labeled ""counterclockwise"", based on an original, yet un-replicated, pilot study by Ellen Langer, at Harvard. A group of older adults (aged 75+) will take part of a residential role-play game, in which they will relive their previous self, acting as if they were in the year 1989. The whole residential program, which will last one week, is designed to enhance this perception, including a retrofitted environment and social activities that will prime participants to relive that period.

The counterclockwise intervention will be tested against an active control group and a no-treatment group, with a randomized controlled trial. People in the active control group will spend a week in the same location of the counterclockwise intervention, mirroring the same activities, without any kind of time manipulation. Participants in the no-treatment group will only receive the assessment. Ninety participants will be randomly allocated to one of these three groups. Every participant will be assessed for medical, cognitive, psychological, and age appearance, four times: at the recruitment, after the intervention (i.e., after a week for the no-treatment group), and again after 6 and 12 months.

Expected results will be able to promote a mindset-shift not only in the participants but in the general population. The communication plan, which is integrated into the project plan, includes the presentation of the results to communities and associations of older adults, using the experiment as a proof of concept. It will demonstrate that challenging rigid, culturally driven, age-related stereotypes can result in health and well-being improvement. This is expected to lead to a significant improvement of empowerment and perceived control, with the potential to become viral in social communications.",Aging

Sunlight exerts many effects on the body. There is evidence that in response to ultraviolet B radiation (UVB), which are the burning rays of sunlight, young adult skin responds differently than geriatric skin. In fact, researchers feel that this difference in how the skin reacts to UVB is why skin cancers are found in older skin. Researchers believe that a major difference between young adult and geriatric skin is that young skin has a lot of a protein called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), whereas geriatric skin has very little. The current study will test how young adult versus geriatric skin responds to UVB, and if geriatric skin treated with an injection of small amount of IGF-1 drug will then act like young skin.","UVB Phototherapy Burn, Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, Aging"

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Can a short (20-minute) tDCS session before a nap improve sleep patterns during the nap?
* Since these sleep patterns are linked to memory and attention, can tDCS also improve thinking skills after the nap?
* Are two tDCS session more effective than one for improving nap sleep and thinking skills?

Participants will:

• Be required to come to the university for testing over four days.

During each session they will:

* Complete computer based-tasks to assess memory and thinking.
* Receive a 20-minute session of either real (active) or fake (placebo) tDCS.
* Take a short, monitored nap while researchers measure sleep activity (using polysomnography - a gold-standard, non-invasive sleep monitoring tool).
* Complete an easy-to-use sleep test at home on the nights after the naps.

  * Wear a lightweight watch (called an Actiwatch) throughout the study period to track sleep and movement.
  * Complete daily sleep diaries.

This number is projected to exceed 300 million by the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan and 400 million by 2035, which would be over 30%. The 20th National Congress emphasized the need for a proactive strategy to tackle aging challenges. Approximately 6.04% of the elderly have dementia, with 3.94% having Alzheimer's disease. This totals around 15 million people with dementia. To address this, the China Cohort Consortium on Aging and Cognitive Impairment Development has been proposed to study health and cognitive changes in different age groups, aiming to support healthy aging policies. Methods: Participants from various age groups (children, youth, middle-aged, elderly) will be recruited from hospitals, schools, and communities using stratified sampling. They will undergo detailed medical examinations focusing on aging, cognitive impairments, and related diseases. A new database will track healthy aging and cognitive impairment development. Content: The study will involve comprehensive medical examinations, including physiological assessments, psychological evaluations, cognitive screenings, daily life assessments, imaging studies, and blood tests, to establish a detailed health and cognitive impairment database.

cell senescence,senescence longevity,NCT03532984,Beam Walking Across the Lifespan for Falls Prediction,UNKNOWN,,"Background: Dynamic balance keeps the vertical projection of the center of mass within the base of support while the center of mass moves. The age-related decrease in dynamic balance is a risk factor for falls. Dynamic balance tests are used to predict the risks for falls and eventual falls but the psychometric properties of most tests assessing dynamic balance are unsatisfactory and comprise no actual loss of balance while walking. Objectives: Using beam walking distance as a measure of dynamic balance, we will determine the psychometric properties, lifespan and patient reference values, the relationship with selected 'dynamic balance tests', and the accuracy of beam walking distance to predict falls. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study will examine healthy adults in 7 decades (n=432) at 4 centers. Center 5 will examine patients (n=100) diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and balance disorders. At Test 1, all participants will be measured for demographics, medical history, grip and leg strength, short physical performance battery, static balance on a force platform, and dynamic balance using beam walking (4m-long, 4, 8, and 12 cm wide) under single (beam walking only) and dual task conditions (beam walking while concurrently performing an arithmetic task). In addition, cognitive function (global cognition, attention, executive function, processing speed, memory) will be assessed. Patients and healthy participants age 50+ will be additionally measured for fear of falling, history of falls, miniBESTest, functional reach on a force platform, timed up and go, and reactive balance. At Test 2, 7-10 days after Test 1, healthy adults young and age 50+ (n=40) will be re-tested for reliability of beam walking performance. All participants age 50+ will be re-called to report fear of falling and fall history 6 and 12 months after Test 1. Conclusion: The investigators expect to find that beam walking performance vis-à-vis the traditionally used balance outcomes predicts more accurately fall risks and falls.","Aging, Parkinson Disease, Stroke, Dementia, Diagnoses Disease, Cognitive Impairment, Postural; Defect"

Health professionals try to provide longevity with good quality of life for this population, through the functional independence maintenance. In this context, physical exercise has an important role, specially the strength training. The ability to produce muscle strength is positively associated with the functionality and independence of older people. Different types of strength training can lead to different neuromuscular and functional gains. These types of interventions can help health professionals to determine characteristics of training for the elderly, aiming the maintenance of their functional independence. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a concentric strength training versus a concentric-eccentric strength training for knee flexors and extensors on structural, neuromuscular and functional parameters in older people, as well as to investigate the effect of a detraining period.

cell senescence,senescence longevity,NCT05237687,The Role of Sirolimus in Preventing Functional Decline in Older Adults,RECRUITING,PHASE2,"Aging is associated with progressive impairment of tissue and organ function, resulting in increased susceptibility to chronic disease, frailty and disability. Currently there are limited treatment options to alter this inevitable process. The proposed work has the potential to identify a new therapeutic intervention to decrease aging-related degenerative processes.

Rapamycin or sirolimus is a macrocyclic immunosuppressive drug that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is part of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent pathway which is a fundamentally linked to cell metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This pathway is altered in a variety of diseases, including cancers, immunosuppressed states, and fibroproliferative diseases. The mTOR kinase is considered one of the leading regulators of this pathway. Changes in mTOR signaling are closely associated with inflammation, cell growth and survival, leading to the development of chronic diseases. Recent evidence also suggests that mTOR inhibitors are promising modulators of the aging process by slowing the mechanisms of aging at the cellular level. There is a growing appreciation of the potential impact of sirolimus in slowing aging processes and in prolonging healthy lifespan.

The proposed study addresses critical gaps in our understanding of the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in delaying aging processes and is based on findings in animal studies and incidental clinical observations. The investigators will overcome potential biases with a randomized control trial. The proposed intervention study is intended to improve our insight into clinical outcomes leading to prevention of chronic diseases such as skin cancer and mortality. Our overarching hypothesis is that sirolimus is one of the first pharmacological agents that will impact the aging process and chronic disease development. Specifically, the investigators aim to investigate whether sirolimus can reduce the occurrence or increase in biomarkers of aging processes.",Aging

The term 'next-generation probiotics' (NGP) is now widely used to describe these commensal species of potential health interest. However, this approach is still hampered by the fact that there are usually few or even no strains available for a number of commensal species. In this context, BIOASTER has developed a specific technological process based on flow cytometry analysis and then sorting under strictly anaerobic conditions to target and cultivate commensal species of interest.

The review of the literature shows that certain species present among centenarians have an interest in maintaining the longevity of these individuals. Numerous studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota of centenarians presents a greater diversity compared to groups of younger subjects as well as an enrichment in certain bacteria such as Akkermansia and Christensenella.

The goal of this observational study is to constitute a biological samples collection from centenarian people, to proceed with the isolation of beneficial commensal strains such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila and Oscillospiraceae, in a non-limitative way.

Growing evidence suggests that lifespan neurobiology of schizophrenia (SZ) incorporates two distinct dimensions: aging and disease course. However, their clinical correlates, associated biomarker trajectories, and implications for treatment are unknown. This study will investigate differential aspects of SZ neurobiology captured by aging and disease course, in order to develop specific biomarkers which may offer actionable targets for SZ stage-dependent intervention. The study is predicated on a novel mechanistic Model of SZ Trajectories across the Adult Lifespan, positing distinct biological fingerprints within the anterior limbic system for aging and disease course in SZ: (1) alterations in the circuit's function and structure that occur earlier in the lifespan and are larger in magnitude than the alterations expected with normal aging (accelerated aging dimension); and (2) regionally-specific anterior limbic ""hyperactivity"" in early SZ, with a subsequent transformation into ""hypoactivity"" in advanced SZ (disease course dimension). In a sample of SZ and matched healthy controls (n=168, 84/group) aged 18-75 years the investigators will ascertain a broad panel of biomarkers \[via multimodal brain imaging: optimized 1H-MRS, high-resolution task-based fMRI, perfusion (Vascular Space Occupancy) and structural MRI\], along with comprehensive cognitive and clinical assessments. All measures will be acquired at baseline and repeated at 2-year longitudinal follow-up. Using cutting-edge computational approaches, the study will examine (i) effects of aging and SZ course on anterior limbic system biomarkers; (ii) lifespan trajectories for different biomarkers; (iii) patterns of limbic system biomarkers in age- and SZ course-based subgroups (e.g., Younger vs. Older, Early-Course vs. Advanced SZ), as well as in data-driven subgroups (e.g., those with vs. without accelerated aging profiles); and (iv) associations between biomarkers and cognitive and clinical outcomes. This research will advance the field by providing novel biomarkers that capture unique neurobiological contributions of aging and disease course in SZ, and will motivate future studies on SZ mechanisms across the lifespan and development of precision treatments.","Schizophrenia, Aging, Disease Course, Biomarker, Neuroimaging, Cognitive Dysfunction"

The worldwide population of older adults is growing rapidly, with one in six people expected to be over age 65 by 2050. This will place further financial burden from chronic diseases on already stressed healthcare systems. While studies show that frequent exercise is an effective way for older adults to maintain or improve cardiovascular and metabolic health, older individuals are less physically active and do not adhere well to exercise programs, often due to physical or medical limitations. Therefore, alternative methods for older adults to get the same health benefits as exercise require further exploration.

However, the tools currently employed to assess skeletal muscle mass (SMM) (e.g., Dual-energy Xray Absorptiometry; DXA) have substantial drawbacks, and it is known that DXA-lean soft tissue (LST) is generally not associated with health outcomes of interest. Thus, the investigators propose using a novel, non-invasive, stable isotope-labelled probe (Deuterium (D)-labelled creatine (D3-creatine; D3-Cr)) to measure skeletal muscle mass in a large cohort of older individuals. The development and employment of new methods to accurately quantify the biological substrate of sarcopenia, skeletal muscle, are critical for the measure to remain clinically relevant.

metabolism,metabolism aging,NCT02413112,Get in Shape in the Team Research: Porukalla Kuntoon Tutkimus,COMPLETED,,"It is well accepted that physical activity in the form of resistance training produces a wide variety of neuromuscular-skeletal and health benefits. It is recommended in Finland that older individuals (over 65yr) should perform resistance training twice per week.

Unfortunately, only approx. 5% of older individuals fulfill this recommendation. As Finnish society grows ever older, research should focus on the specific needs of this group and how to improve participation in physical activity, which may ultimately lead to modification of physical activity recommendations - resistance training recommendations are currently the same for young and older adults and do not include specific recommendations on the type of resistance training. However, these recommendations appear to have been developed for ""best possible"" improvements in maximum strength and muscle size.

Therefore, it is of great importance to identify the number of resistance training sessions per week required to induce improvements in physical fitness, metabolic and bone health status, and importantly the reasons for adherence to/drop-out of resistance training interventions (e.g. motivation to train) in a multi-discipline study. This knowledge would benefit policy makers to update current recommendations for resistance training and to devise strategies to advise realistic targets for resistance training in the older, particularly the less-educated, age group (e.g. TELI-strategy for 2020).

The present study will include a 12-month resistance training intervention with a 12-month follow-up period.

Seminal work on sleep deprivation and thermoregulation has demonstrated that sleep-deprived individuals experience greater elevations in core temperature during exercise-heat stress due to reductions in the activation of local heat loss responses of cutaneous vasodilation and sweating. However, it remains unclear 1) if reductions in local heat loss responses would compromise whole-body heat loss (evaporative + dry heat exchange) and 2) if differences exist, are they dependent on the heat load generated by exercise (increases in metabolic rate augments the rate that heat must be dissipated by the body). Further, much of the understanding of the effects of sleep deprivation on thermoregulation has been limited to assessments in young adults. Studies show that aging is associated with reduction in cutaneous vasodilation and sweating that compromise whole-body heat loss exacerbating body heat storage during moderate- and especially more vigorous-intensity exercise in the heat. However, it remains unclear if sleep deprivation may worsen this response in older adults.

The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate the effects of sleep-deprivation on whole-body total heat loss during light, moderate, and vigorous exercise-heat stress and to assess if aging may mediate this response.

Effective and feasible methods, such as dietary therapies, are needed to improve health in older adults that in turn lead to independence, enhanced quality of life and reduced hospitalizations. Diet quality and dietary protein intake are vital for maintaining body composition, muscle mass and improved physical performance. Malnutrition in dietary protein intake is a major cause of reduced muscle mass, strength, and function in older adults. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is a high-quality therapeutic diet known to improve health status in various diverse and at-risk populations resulting in improved heart health, maintained cognitive function and reductions in metabolic diseases such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The primary protein recommendations of the DASH diet are poultry and fish and it is recommended to decrease or exclude red meats from the diet. However, studies have demonstrated that lean red meat incorporated into a DASH-like diet doesn't exacerbate cardiovascular health indices in adults, indicating that lean red meat can be included in the DASH diet without negative effects on heart health.

metabolism,metabolism aging,NCT02949115,Effects of Red Beetroot Juice on High-Fat Meal-Induced Endothelial Dysfunction and Cardiometabolic Disturbances,UNKNOWN,PHASE2,"Aside from aging, numerous factors increase the risk for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) including diet and nutrition. High-fat meal consumption induces postprandial vascular endothelial dysfunction and other cardiometabolic disturbances (e.g. dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia) in normal weight individuals and is exacerbated in overweight/obese individuals. These postprandial responses are likely largely due to activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant pathways. Given that much of the day is spent in the postprandial state, this may further impair cardiovascular health in aging overweight/obese individuals. Interventions that attenuate these responses are needed. Red beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) is an excellent source of bioactive compounds including nitrate, flavonoids, phenolic acids, betalains, carotenoids, and ascorbic acid. These bioactive compounds and their metabolites have been shown to have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and cardiovascular-protective effects. These effects, particularly the cardiovascular-protective effects, have been primarily attributed to its high content of nitrate since it is converted to nitric oxide independent of the vascular endothelium via the enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway. However, red beetroot juice contains a number of other potentially beneficial bioactive compounds and few studies have aimed to determine whether these compounds work independently, additively, or synergistically in exerting these effects. Given the findings of previously conducted research in the broad area of red beetroot juice consumption and human health, it can be suggested that: 1) acute red beetroot juice consumption may prevent or attenuate the adverse postprandial responses to consuming a high-fat meal in individuals with exaggerated responses; and 2) chronic consumption of red beetroot may improve underlying factors contributing to these exaggerated responses. Accordingly, this project aims to: 1) investigate the efficacy of acute and chronic whole red beetroot juice consumption compared with its bioactive components in attenuating postprandial vascular endothelial dysfunction and adverse cardiometabolic responses to a high-fat meal; and 2) to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms responsible.","Overweight, Obesity, Aging, Menopause"

AMPK is susceptible to modulation through pharmacologic (e.g. metformin) and non-pharmacologic (e.g. physical exercise) interventions. This clinical trial aims to describe the effects of the AMPK pathway on longevity genes and inflammation in the setting of pre-diabetes in vivo and in vitro. To this end, the investigators will compare treatment with metformin (500 mg t.i.d) for 2 months, versus placebo in pre-diabetic subjects.

In addition, considering the effects of strength exercise in promoting health, we aimed to test the effects of strength training over the HSR in diabetic elderly people. Thirty (19 females and 11 males) sedentary non-smoking participants volunteered for this study (11 healthy middle-age adults, 7 healthy old adults and 12 diabetic old subjects, previously diagnosed by their personal physicians).

Firstly, venous blood samples were obtained from all participants to test the HSR. They were divided in three groups: healthy middle-age adults (45-59 y.o.), healthy elderly adults and elderly diabetic (\> 60 y.o.). As we identify that diabetic people presented a poor HSR, we submit the diabetic group to a twelve-week resistance exercise training to verify if this intervention could improve the HS response.

Diabetic subjects were randomly (1:1 block randomization) allocated in one of the two groups: Trained and Control (no training). Strength training was performed three times per week while the control group performed a ""placebo"" stretching/relaxing session once a week (for adherence purposes). Both interventions had twelve weeks of duration. To avoid any significant adaptation, all stretching exercises (for large muscle groups only) were performed at very low intensity without any significant discomfort.

Supervised (by qualified sport and exercise scientists) exercise was performed in a gym on three non-consecutive days of the week. Each session lasted \~60 min and consisted of a warm up, the resistance exercise training and a cool down. The training programme consisted of a combination of upper and lower body exercises using gym equipments, free weights and body weight as the primary resistance. The twelve weeks of strength training were divided into three mesocycles of four weeks each. Exercises included leg press, knee extensions and leg curls, biceps curls, triceps extensions, lat pull-downs, shoulder press, bench press and abdominal crunch. Before the start of the training period, subjects completed a familiarization session to practice the exercises they would further perform during the training sessions, where the exercise load was individually tested. The resistance training was performed using two to three sets per exercise at intensities between 12-15 repetition maximum-RM.","Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Aging"
metabolism,metabolism aging,NCT00455741,Postmenopausal Women Estrogen and Progesterone Infusion,COMPLETED,"PHASE1, PHASE2","The purpose of the study is to study the effects of aging, estrogen and progesterone on the brain. Specifically, we want to look at how the hypothalamus and pituitary (two small glands in the brain) respond to estrogen. The pituitary gland is controlled by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) that signals the pituitary to secrete the reproductive hormones, LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone). These hormones act on the ovaries and signal the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen in the bloodstream then acts on the brain to modulate this system with changes in LH and FSH. Early changes associated with low levels of estrogen are inhibitory (estrogen negative feedback) while higher levels of estrogen (such as those present when a follicle in the ovary is ready to ovulate) stimulate LH to cause ovulation (positive feedback). This study will determine: 1) hypothalamic and pituitary levels of glucose uptake (as a measure of brain metabolic activity) at baseline and in association with estrogen negative feedback on LH (24 hr) and estrogen positive feedback on LH (72 hr); and 2) the effect of aging on estrogen feedback on LH, assessing negative feedback (nadir \~ 24 hr) and positive feedback (peak between 72 and 96 hr).","Postmenopause, Aging"

The purpose of this research is to study how the decrease in estrogen at menopause changes artery health and fat gain, and risk of disease in women as they age. The first aim in this study will determine whether short term and long term low estrogen levels in premenopausal women decreases artery function and whether this is related to an increase in fat in the stomach area. The second aim will determine whether the changes in artery health and body fat are related to changes in a pathway that breaks down an important amino acid called tryptophan. This pathway is thought to play a role in regulating the aging process. Therefore, the investigators will determine whether the decrease in artery health and the increase in body fat in the stomach region with low estrogen is related to changes in this pathway in the blood, in vascular cells and fat tissue. Because estrogen levels fluctuate in premenopausal women, the investigators will use an approach (intervention) that controls estrogen levels to address these aims. The investigators will use a medication that is typically used to treat endometriosis or uterine fibroids to lower estrogen levels and an estrogen patch to increase estrogen in some women. Some women will receive a patch that has no estrogen (called a placebo patch). The intervention period will be 20 weeks.

metabolism,metabolism aging,NCT06367296,Resistance Exercise Training in the Older Population With Obesity,RECRUITING,,"Background:

Aging leads to an alteration in the immune response, characterized by a chronic inflammatory state, and a progressive decrease in muscle quantity and quality, a situation that increases in women and in the presence of obesity. With respect to muscle quality, intramuscular infiltration of adipose tissue has been considered a relevant parameter, involved in the relationship between aging-obesity-inflammation. As a therapeutic strategy, physical training with resistance exercises (or also known as strength training) has been shown to be effective in increasing skeletal muscle mass in this age group. However, its role on muscle quality in normal-weight versus obese older women has not been fully addressed.

Hypothesis:

A 12-week resistance exercise training program is effective in improving muscle quality, immune response and physical performance in normal weight and obese older women. In addition to the above, the investigators hypothesize that women with obesity will present greater baseline alterations, so the percentage of change will be higher compared to older women with normal weight after the training program.

Goals:

The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 12-week resistance exercise training on muscle quality (infiltration of intramuscular adipose tissue), immune response and physical performance in older women between 60 and 79 years of age with obesity compared to older women with normal weight of the same age range.

Methodology:

The present clinical trial will consider 2 groups of older women between 60 and 79 years old: normal weight (BMI=18.5 to 24.9 kg/m 2 and % fat \<25.9) and obese (BMI =30 to 39.9 Kg/m 2 and fat % \>32).

SO is associated with a greater risk of health-related adverse clinical outcomes than older adults with obesity and sarcopenia alone. Aging is accompanied by numerous changes epigenetic. These aging-associated epigenetic changes include DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regulation, and RNA modification. DNA methylation occurs at cytosines in CpG dinucleotides in the genome and undergoes changes with age in various human tissues. Furthermore, many genes can be hypermethylated or hypomethylated on CpG islands with the aging process. Soon, a broad exploration of candidate genes may provide insights into the pathogenesis of Sarcopenic obesity. Therefore, understanding how aging, specifically sarcopenia, obesity and Sarcopenic obesity, is regulated by epigenetic factors, favors the development of new treatment therapies. Thus, the objective will be to evaluate the epigenetic influence on sarcopenic obesity in older women. METHODS: This cross-sectional study will include 32 older women who will be classified as healthy, with sarcopenia, obesity and sarcopenic obesity living in the city of Ribeirão Preto - SP. The older adults will perform total and regional body scan using iDXA, anthropometric assessment, functional capacity tests, peripheral blood collection for analysis of biochemical markers and epigenetics. For statistical analysis will be used t test, ANOVA, linear regression models and Pearson correlation. Analyzes of the complete methylome will be performed using bioinformatics tools, including specific software. EXPECTED RESULTS: It is expected that there will be differences in the patterns of methylation and gene expression in the diseases analyzed. In addition, it is expected to clarify how epigenetic changes occur throughout this process.","Sarcopenic Obesity, Sarcopenia, Obesity, Epigenesis, Genetic, Aging"

Specifically, the glycocalyx protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress and inflammation and enables blood vessel dilation, which is largely dependent on the bioavailability of the vasodilatory molecule nitric oxide. Importantly, glycocalyx thickness decreases with age and is predictive of major adverse cardiovascular events in older adults free of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, interventions aimed at restoring glycocalyx thickness in older adults are desperately needed. Endocalyx Pro is a commercially available glycocalyx precursor supplement, manufactured by Microvascular Health Solutions, designed to 1) repair a damaged glycocalyx, 2) protect against damage to the glycocalyx, and 3) synthesize new glycocalyx components, and has been used to increase glycocalyx thickness in humans. However, no study has tested if glycocalyx thickness restores glycocalyx thickness in older adults and improves blood vessel function. Thus, the purpose of this investigation is to determine if 12-weeks of Endocalyx Pro supplementation alters glycocalyx thickness and blood vessel function in older adults.

stem cells,cells aging,NCT06039527,TINO: T Cells in the Nose of Older Adults,RECRUITING,,"Rationale: Individuals with advanced age are at a progressively increasing risk of acquiring lower respiratory tract infections. Besides calendar age, the degree of frailty also associates with increased susceptibility to pneumonia requiring hospitalization. How alterations in the mucosal immune system with advanced age predispose to infections remains unclear as access to relevant tissue samples is limited. With minimally-invasive nasal sampling methods, it was recently observed that in vital older adults, both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells are selectively lost from the nasal mucosa. However, the exact phenotype, underlying mechanisms, key molecules and consequences of this have not yet been investigated.

Objective:

Elucidate the mechanisms underlying the loss of nasal T cells and characterize in depth the differences of T cells in young and older adults and associate this loss with susceptibility to infections.

Study design: Prospective cohort study

Study population: Participants will be recruited from 3 groups:

* healthy young adults (18-30 years, n=50)
* vital older adults (\>65 years, n=60)
* frail elderly (\>65 years, n=60). This group includes individuals without a history of recurrent respiratory infections or with \>2 self-reported episodes of respiratory infection in the past year.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Frequency of nasal CD8+ T cells in young adults and frail older adults.

Secondary study parameters/endpoints:

* Phenotype (subsets, activation status), functionality, transcriptomic state, clonality and frequency of nasal and blood T cell populations
* Stability of T cells and other immune parameters, as described for main study parameter, during a second sample after 3 months.
* Analysis of other immune populations as for main study parameter
* Concentration of nasal and systemic factors (e.g. cytokines and metabolites) and their association with T cells and other immune populations
* Respiratory tract microbiota profiles and presence of asymptomatic viral infections and their association with T cells and other immune parameters

To achieve this goal, a mechanistic randomized controlled (RCT) will be conducted, in which adults are randomized to 12-weeks intervention of AE or no-exercise Control. Our overall hypothesis is that the exercise response variation in vascular benefits is related to age and sex differences in the biological changes underlying vascular aging and/or the molecular transducers (i.e., circulating molecules) that communicate and coordinate the effects of AE on the vasculature in the periphery and brain. Because this is a mechanistic trial, the overall goal is not a single health-related outcome. Rather, the goal is to advance our understanding of the molecular signals and pathways underlying the systemic and local effects of AE on vascular health that may explain the variability in AE responses with age and sex.

stem cells,cells aging,NCT05000515,"Inspiratory Muscle Strength Training for Lowering Blood Pressure and Improving Endothelial Function in Postmenopausal Women: Comparison With ""Standard of Care"" Aerobic Exercise",RECRUITING,,"High blood pressure (BP) is the major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related health conditions, particularly among postmenopausal (PM) women. In adults age ≥50 years this risk is primarily driven by above-normal systolic BP (SBP ≥120 mmHg), as diastolic BP plateaus, then decreases in older adulthood. Although SBP is lower in premenopausal women vs. age-matched men, SBP reaches, then surpasses men after age 60. As such, \>75% of PM women in the U.S. have above-normal SBP, which, in turn, is responsible for a 2-fold increase in risk of hypertension and corresponding increases in risk of CVD, chronic kidney disease and many other disorders. A key process linking high SBP to CVD and related conditions is vascular endothelial dysfunction, mediated by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stress and reductions in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. As the number of PM women is rapidly growing, further increases in SBP-related CV disorders are projected without effective intervention.

* Aerobic exercise (AE) is a first-line, standard-of-care therapy for lowering BP. In PM women with baseline SBP ≥120 mmHg, AE reduces casual (resting) SBP by \~3 mmHg (back to baseline ≤4 weeks post-training), whereas 24-hour SBP is typically unchanged. However, only 25-30% of PM women meet guidelines for 150 min/week of moderate-intensity AE, citing the extensive time requirement, facility access and travel disruptions as major barriers. Another, far less recognized, limitation is that AE training consistently improves endothelial function in midlife/older men, but not in estrogen-deficient PM (PMe-) women, i.e., in \>95% of the 60+million PM women in the U.S. Thus, establishing new lifestyle therapies that induce and sustain reductions in SBP and increases in endothelial function in PMe- women with above-normal SBP is an important public health goal.
* High-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) is a time-efficient (5 minutes per session) lifestyle intervention consisting of 30 inspiratory maneuvers performed against a high resistance. Preliminary data suggest 6-weeks of IMST performed 6 days/week reduces SBP by 9 mmHg in adults with above-normal SBP (i.e., greater than 120 mmHg) at baseline. Importantly, this reduction in SBP is equal to or greater than the reduction in blood pressure typically achieved with time- and effort-intensive healthy lifestyle strategies like conventional aerobic exercise. In addition, IMST improved endothelial function in the PMe- women in a small pilot study.
* To translate these promising preliminary results towards clinical practice, this randomized clinical trial is being conducted to directly compare the efficacy of a longer, clinically relevant treatment duration of IMST (3 months) against home-based, moderate-intensity (standard-of-care) AE in PMe-women. The primary outcome will be the change in casual SBP (IMST vs. AE). Changes in 24-hour SBP and endothelial function will serve as secondary outcomes. Effects on NO bioavailability, ROS/oxidative stress, and the role of ""circulating factors"" will provide insight into mechanisms of action. The sustained effects on SBP and endothelial function also will be assessed.
* Accordingly, a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled, parallel group design clinical trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy of 3-months of IMST (75 percent maximal inspiratory pressure) vs. brisk walking (40-60% heart rate reserve; an established healthy lifestyle strategy) for lowering SBP and improving endothelial function in PMe- women age 50 years and older with above-normal SBP. It is hypothesized that IMST will lower SBP and improve endothelial function by decreasing oxidative stress and increasing nitric oxide bioavailability. It is also expect that adherence to the intervention will be excellent (over 80 percent of all training sessions completed at the appropriate intensity).
* To test this hypothesis, 90 PMe- women age 50 years and older who have SBP \>/= 120 mmHg will be recruited. Participants will undergo baseline testing for casual (resting) SBP, 24-hour ambulatory SBP and endothelial function. Innovative mechanistic probes including pharmaco-dissection with vitamin C, analysis of biopsied endothelial cells, and high-throughput metabolomics, will be performed to assess oxidative stress and nitric oxide bioavailability at baseline.
* After baseline testing, subjects will be randomized to perform either 3-months of high-resistance IMST or brisk walking. Subjects will train 6 days/week. Following 3 months of training, subjects will redo all the tests that were done during baseline testing to assess training-induced changes in SBP, physiological functions, and underlying mechanisms. Subjects will then cease training for 6 weeks before returning to the lab for follow-up testing to determine the persistent effects of IMST.","Aging, Blood Pressure, Endothelial Dysfunction, Hypertension"
stem cells,cells aging,NCT01169831,Regulation of Endothelial Progenitor Cells by Short-Term Exercise,COMPLETED,,"Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) are circulating cells released from bone marrow which are important for maintaining cardiovascular health. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in older adults is associated with reduced circulating EPC numbers. Studies have shown reduced EPC number and function in old vs. young individuals, and endurance exercise training increases EPC number and function in young adults. Oxidative stress adversely affects endothelial cells and preliminary evidence indicates that oxidative stress negatively affects EPC function. Conversely, regular exercise reduces markers of oxidative stress and may enhance EPC function in older adults. The investigators hypothesize that older endurance-trained athletes and matched sedentary individuals will have markedly divergent EPC function and that altering the physical activity levels of both groups will move them to intermediate points between these two extremes. The investigators also propose that the investigators can ""mimic"" the effect of exercise training on EPC function in cell culture by altering intracellular levels of a key enzyme and a signaling molecule which the investigators have shown to regulate EPC function with respect to exercise training in young individuals.","Aging, Exercise, Cardiovascular Disease"

stem cells,cells aging,NCT05951439,Effect of Creatine+HMB Supplementation in Physically Active Older Adults,COMPLETED,,"Sarcopenia (SAR) is the loss of muscle strength and mass caused by aging. It is accompanied by a progressive decline in physical and cognitive abilities, increasing the risk of falls. This loss of muscle mass leads to pathophysiological changes at the neuromuscular and tendon levels as a consequence, among others, of alterations in the balance between protein synthesis and degradation, inflammation (INF), or alterations in the anabolic/catabolic state (ACS). These alterations are caused by oxidative stress (OS), when reactive oxygen species-toxic metabolites produced by cells using oxygen-exceed the defensive capacity of the antioxidant system.

Therapeutic strategies to modulate SAR are based on exercise and nutrition programs. Multicomponent physical exercise programs have shown improvements in parameters related to sarcopenia. Likewise, the use of nutritional supplements such as creatine (CRE) has demonstrated improvements in muscle function in older adults. CRE may reduce INF and OS in the general population.

On the other hand, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) also appears to improve muscle function in older adults by promoting myogenesis. However, the effects of these supplements in older adults have only been observed when used in isolation. In this regard, our research team observed that a 10-week regimen combining 3 g/day of CRE + 3 g/day of HMB (CRE-HMB) improved muscle recovery (better ACS) and physical performance in athletes subjected to high muscle wear. However, to date, it has not been determined whether this combination improves muscle function, OS, INF, and ACS in women with SAR.

Therefore, the working hypothesis is that the CRE-HMB combination could improve muscle function and physical performance, as well as OS, INF, and ACS in individuals with high muscle loss, such as those with SAR. Thus, a randomized double-blind crossover study is proposed to analyze the effect of 12 weeks-6 weeks of intervention + 3 weeks of washout + 3 weeks of intervention-of co-supplementation with 3 g/day of CRE + 3 g/day of HMB (CRE-HMB), combined with 4 sessions/week of multicomponent physical exercise, on muscle function, OS, INF, and ACS in 40 physically active men and women over 60 years of age. These 40 participants will be divided into two groups of 20 (20 in the placebo group and 20 in the CRE-HMB group).

At the assessment points (baseline, at 6 weeks, after the 3-week washout period, and after another 6 weeks), body composition, nutritional intake, muscle strength, and performance tests will be evaluated. Blood samples will also be collected to determine biochemical markers of OS, INF, and ACS.

It is expected that CRE-HMB co-supplementation for 6 + 6 weeks, together with multicomponent physical exercise, in physically active older adults will improve muscle strength, muscle mass, and performance. Additionally, improvements in OS, INF, and ACS levels are anticipated.","Aging, Sarcopenia, Nutrition, Healthy"

Overall, the project directs to find out the long term effect of training on fall risk reduction and fall prevention.

This study investigates the effects of perturbation training (slip and trip) based on the principles of motor learning. Perturbations in the form of slips and trips induced by the three different types of perturbation devices will displace the center of mass outside the base of support and challenge the stability, thereby inducing a fall and demand compensatory strategies in order to prevent it. Such perturbation training would train the motor system to improve stability control and vertical limb support.

The project design aims to examine the ability of the central nervous system to mitigate the interference in stability control (if any) that is induced by opposing types of perturbations. The hypothesis of this study if supported by the results, will provide the difference in motor learning with training on three different perturbation devices. Furthermore, it would help to determine which of the three training devices is the most effective in developing defense mechanisms necessary to reduce fall-risk among community-living older adults and the neurological population.","Healthy Young, Healthy Aging, Stroke"

stem cells,cells aging,NCT04836793,COVID-19-Study of Immune Responses Following Vaccination Against SARS-CoV-2,UNKNOWN,,"T-cell adaptive immunity is known to be required to sustain a long term immunoglobulin production and a long term memory against several infections. Previous results suggest a lack in the generation of T-cell responses against CoV-N, M and S proteins among cancer patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus highlighting that cancer patients failed to mount a protective T-cell immunity. Given this context, our hypothesis is that COVID-19 vaccine candidates are not immunogenic in some cancer patients. Thus, the monitoring of CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses before and after vaccination might provide information related to the correlation between induction of CD4 T-cells (including helper follicular T-cells) by the vaccine and long-term IgG production (serological index). Additionally, the failure of COVID-19 vaccines in some patients should be monitor carefully in order to provide specific recommendations to avoid COVID-19 infections.

Aging is the primary risk factor for CVD, in large part due to adverse modifications to the arteries. These modifications include vascular endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness. Vascular endothelial dysfunction is an initiating step in atherosclerosis, and is primarily caused by reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability secondary to excessive superoxide-driven oxidative stress and inflammation. Endothelial dysfunction leads to arterial stiffness and the development of hypertension (HTN) which further increases CVD. Greater than 2/3 of the US population has elevated blood pressure or stage 1-HTN. As such, interventions that improve vascular endothelial dysfunction by increasing NO bioavailability and mitigating excessive oxidative stress and inflammation are needed. Blueberries are rich in bioactive compounds including flavonoids, phenolic acids, and pterostilbene. These compounds and their metabolites have been shown to attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation.

Advancing age appears to exert its pathological influence primarily via adverse functional and structural effects on arteries. Aging is associated with increased stiffness (reduced compliance) of large elastic arteries and impaired arterial endothelial function that is characterized by reductions in nitric oxide (NO)- mediated endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD). While several changes to arteries may contribute to age-associated increases in CVD risk; the development of endothelial dysfunction and stiffening of the large elastic arteries are among the most important contributors. Both are predictors of CV events and clinical CVD with increasing age.

Currently, there are few studies focusing on the effects of long-duration physical activity interventions in older adults. Thus, the purpose of the following study was to analyze the effects of an 8-month multicomponent intervention program on cardiorespiratory capacity, body composition, and strength in a group of nonagenarians. A secondary objective was to determine if the impact of the program differed according to the participants' way of life (institutionalized vs. community dwelling).

Methods Participants Participants in this research represent a subset from an ongoing study aimed at collecting baseline and follow-up data over three years, to evaluate the health-related changes observed in a cohort of older adults f The present research was carried out on the basis of data obtained from the individuals in this sample who participated in a multicomponent intervention program offered to the inhabitants of the said region and who met the following inclusion criteria: a) being ninety years of age or older; and b) holding a medical certificate confirming their suitability for sport. The exclusion criteria were a) lack of independent ambulation (walking with an assistive device); b) recent upper or lower limb injuries; c) neurological or orthopedic diagnosis in upper or lower-extremities.

Intervention A multicomponent intervention program was developed consisting of two 60-minute sessions per week, held on non-consecutive days, for a period of 8 months. The sessions consisted of a warm-up phase (10') in which individuals performed joint mobility exercises and walked at a rate of 3 km/h. Afterwards, muscular strength work was carried out on the upper and lower limbs, including calisthenic exercises, and the use of dumbbells or medicine balls (1-3kg). Generally, the exercises were organized in two sets of 10-15 repetitions, resting for two minutes between sets. Communal ball games and relay games were then practiced (over a distance of 30 meters). Finally, 10 minutes were devoted to relaxation and stretching exercises. multicomponent intervention program was designed and monitored by a specialist in gerontogymnastics.

Evaluations Two weeks before the start and after the end of the exercise program, a series of assessments were carried out, which were monitored by specialists in physical exercise and sport, who did not know whether those evaluated were institutionalized or not.

Body composition Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a Tefal digital scale (type PP1200VO) with the participants wearing light clothing and no shoes. Height was measured to the nearest millimeter with a field stadiometer (Seca 220). The body mass index (BMI) was calculated taking the body weight in kilograms and dividing it by the height in meters squared (BMI: kg/m2).

Densitometry Bone mineral density content (BMD) of the femoral neck was measured using a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) machine (Hologic QDR 1000®), which reported BMD in grams per square centimeter (g/cm2). This method was used to ensure better reproducibility, a lower radiation dose and better image resolution (Watts 2004). The minimum significant alteration, with a 95% confidence interval, was 4.7%.

Muscular strength Upper limb muscle strength was assessed with the Handgrip Test (HG) on the right hand using a dynamometer (SH5001, SAEHAN Corporation, South Korea). For each measurement, patients were asked to perform their maximum voluntary contraction for 5s. Each measurement was repeated three times with patients resting for 30s between trials. The best performance was recorded for further analysis. Lower limb muscle strength was assessed with the Isometric Knee Extension Test (KNEE), performed three times on the right leg with participants seated on a custom-built chair with a load cell (Vetek VZ101BS, Vaddo, Sweden). For each measurement, participants were asked to perform their maximum voluntary contraction for 5 s. The test was repeated 3 times and participants rested for 2 min between trials. The best performance from the three trials was considered for further analysis.

Cardiorespiratory fitness In order to assess the effect of the program on the participants' cardiorespiratory fitness, the six-minute walk test (6MWT), was performed, following standard procedure. The subjects were instructed to walk at their own pace from one end to the other of a 100-foot-long measured distance in an enclosed, level, corridor, and to cover as much ground as possible in 6 min. They were allowed to stop and rest during the test, but were instructed to resume walking as soon as they felt able to do so.","Quality of Life, Healthy, Aging, Physical Activity"

These indications will also be present and available for consultation in a special section of the site on the ""HEBE"" site, with UMilan domain (www.hebe.unimi.it).

After 6 months, all UMilan employees will receive a second invitation to voluntarily complete the same questionnaire, in order to evaluate any changes, in terms of lifestyle improvement (time one: T1).

PHASE 2:

100 eligible subjects who have expressed their availability in the initial questionnaire, will be identified to undergo a lifestyle improvement protocol based mainly on the prescription of a personalized exercise program, which will define modalities, intensity, duration, frequency and progression of the exercise. For each subject, at T0 and T1 (after 6 months), biological samples will be collected (blood, urine, saliva and nasal swab), which will be used to: i) set up a biobank shared by the members of the HEBE consortium; ii) identify biomarkers able to monitor the effect of physical exercise on the characteristics of the frailty under examination. Furthermore, both at T0 and T1 questionnaires will be completed and carried out clinical evaluations (anamnesis, physical examination, tests for the study of the autonomic nervous system, bio-impedance test, evaluation/estimate of maximal oxygen consumption, ECG).",Aging

These age-related changes in muscle function may be explained by chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. Despite the recommendation of a higher protein intake, little is known about how different protein sources may affect the metabolic health in this population. Analysis of amino acid composition show that fish can be a good protein source for humans. Many fish species are today used as feed ingredients, rather than a protein source for humans. A few studies conducted in humans and rats show that proteins from fish may improve glucose tolerance, reduce inflammation and improve lipid metabolism, indicating that proteins from fish may not only serve as a valuable nutrient but could also hold specific health promoting properties.

inflammation,inflammation aging,NCT04861857,Effects of Parmigiano Reggiano on Muscle and Inflammatory Response to Eccentric Resistance Training in Older Adults,UNKNOWN,,"Aging is associated with the loss of muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) and reduced tissue regenerative capacity.

Eccentric exercise (ECC) is a model of RET that can be used with the elderly, due to the ability of the muscle to combine high muscle strength production with low energy cost. ECC contractions are significantly more damaging to the muscles and produce greater muscle strength, for these reasons there is a greater risk of inducing muscle damage before the muscle is able to adapt.

Parmigiano Reggiano (PR) has some peculiar bromatological characteristics. The proteins contained in it, and in particular the potentially bioactive peptide sequences, can rapidly provide the amino acids necessary to promote muscle growth and repair during exercise. Furthermore, PR can be an important source of fatty acids, of which a significant amount of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) which are known to have important clinical effects on body composition and metabolic health and can have a systemic anti-inflammatory effect.

Therefore, the central hypothesize is that PR consumed while being engaged in a RET can provide more energy substrates and improve muscle recovery, redcue inflammatory markers and improve lipid metabolism. To date, no studies have studied its function on recovery from exercise nor in the elderly.","Atrophy, Muscular, Aging, Inflammation, Cholesterol Deposition"

inflammation,inflammation aging,NCT04887675,Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration in HIV-positive Subjects Switched and Initially Treated With INSTI,UNKNOWN,,"Since the HIV changed its course to the chronic disease, high incidence of metabolic syndrome both in HIV positive and negative subjects has become an issue. Given the successful peripheral suppression of HIV after introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), comorbidities associated with aging and cognitive functioning, play the main role in the overall quality of life and adherence to the therapy. Continuous low-level neuroinflammation results in continuous and diffuse neuronal death or dysfunction leading to a certain level of neurodegeneration. Additionally, metabolic syndrome contributes to neurodegeneration causing damage to the brain vasculature and provoking the ischemic incidents.

The aim of this study would be to explore the influence of switching to the INSTI based cART using neuroimaging biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration. The second aim would be to monitor these neuroimaging biomarkers in patients receiving INSTI-based cART in a one-year follow-up period. Additionally, we would compare the markers of metabolic syndrome and cognitive functioning (executive functions) in HIV-positive patients after switching to INSTI-based cART and in HIV-positive patients receiving INSTI-based cART from the start.

This study represents a single-center, prospective, interventional, two-armed single study. Arm I will include 60 patients on PI/EFV based ART, stable on treatment, who are switched to INSTI based regimen at the beginning of the study due to side effects or long-term toxicities like hyperlipidemia, diarrhea, (PI), insomnia, headache (EFV), high Framingham score (PI/EFV). Arm II will include 60 patients initially on INSTI-based ART, stable on treatment. The same data sets will be collected for both groups of patients. The variables collected will be related to metabolic syndrome (levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin, glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference, waist to hip and waist to height ratio), performance on neurocognitive tests and MR spectroscopy neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration markers at the beginning of the study, as well as in 12 months follow up. Presence of steatosis and visceral fat thickness will be assessed using ultrasonography of abdomen.

Anthropometric measurements will be acquired at the time of blood sampling. Statistical analysis will be performed after collecting the data.

Ageing can result in major changes in the composition and activities of the bacteria in your gut, leading to a higher incidence of gastrointestinal infections, decreased intestinal motility and impaired bowel function as people get older. This can result in constipation or diarrhoea, increased levels of inflammation and reduced immune response to infection. Therefore, individuals aged 65 or over could benefit from safe and effective interventions that maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria as well as restoring the immune response. Bacteria in the gut are known to promote health. Eating foods containing beneficial bacteria for example (probiotics) or food which contain substrates for the bacteria to grow on (prebiotics) can improve the balance of gut bacteria. The investigators will use a synbiotic with known anti-inflammatory properties, comprising a probiotic Bifidobacterium longum strain and inulin (Synergy 1), The synbiotic has been previously shown to be beneficial in reducing inflammation and to increase levels of beneficial bacteria in the gut in two studies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

inflammation,inflammation aging,NCT01234506,Oxidative Stress and Nutritional Supplementation Intervention Study,COMPLETED,PHASE2,"A major means whereby oxidative stress promotes aging-related disease is by activating inflammatory pathways. Decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation should ameliorate many of the problems associated with aging, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, muscle wasting, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Animal and human studies have demonstrated that consumption of vitamin D and phase 2 protein inducers decrease oxidative stress and associated inflammation. The flax lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) is metabolized to enterolactone, a potent phase 2 protein inducer. Animal and human studies have shown that consumption of flax seed or its component SDG decreases hypertension, serum cholesterol, atherosclerosis, the growth of experimentally-induced cancers as well as metastases of human breast tumours implanted into nude mice, and delays the development of type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D plays a role in modulating inflammation, enhancing immunity (while suppressing autoimmune injury) and exerting control over cell differentiation. Adequate levels of vitamin D also appear to promote better glycemic control. The investigators predict that consumption of SDG in persons with adequate vitamin D status will decrease oxidative stress and associated inflammation. If this hypothesis is upheld, this research has the potential to greatly decrease healthcare costs while allowing healthier aging.","Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, Aging, Dementia, Pain"

Interestingly, people who regularly exercise show less signs of inflamm-aging compared to people with a sedentary lifestyle. Molecules secreted by skeletal muscles, called myokines, may play an important role. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown.

inflammation,inflammation aging,NCT06868719,Ketone Ester And Salt (KEAS) in Older Adults,RECRUITING,,"Most Americans consume excess dietary salt based on the recommendations set by the American Heart Association and Dietary Guidelines for Americans. High dietary salt impairs blood pressure control by affecting systemic blood vessels and the kidneys. These changes contribute to excess salt consumption being associated with increased risk for chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in America. Salt is particularly deleterious in older adults who are more likely to exhibit salt-sensitive hypertension. However, salt consumption remains high in the United States. Thus, there is a critical need for strategies to counteract the effects of high dietary salt as consumption is likely not going to decrease. One promising option is ketones, metabolites that are produced in the liver during prolonged exercise and very low-calorie diets. While exercise and low-calorie diets are beneficial, not many people engage in these activities. Limited evidence indicates that ketone supplements improve cardiovascular health in humans. Additionally, published rodent data indicates that ketone supplements prevent high salt-induced increases in blood pressure, blood vessel dysfunction, and kidney injury. Our human pilot data also indicates that high dietary salt reduces intrinsic ketone production, but it is unclear whether ketone supplementation confers humans' protection against high salt similar to rodents. Therefore, the investigators seek to conduct a short-term high-dietary salt study to determine whether ketone supplementation prevents high dietary salt from eliciting increased blood pressure, blood vessel dysfunction, and kidney injury/impaired blood flow. The investigators will also measure inflammatory markers in blood samples and isolate immune cells that control inflammation. Lastly, the investigators will also measure blood ketone concentration and other circulating metabolites that may be altered by high salt, which could facilitate novel therapeutic targets to combat high salt.","Salt; Excess, Hypertension, Aging, Inflammation, Blood Pressure"
inflammation,inflammation aging,NCT07109596,"Integration of Clinical, Biological and Psycho-social Variables for a Gender-sensitive Frailty Prediction",RECRUITING,,"The progressive aging of the population worldwide yields profound health and social implications. Aging entails a progressive impairment of functions and, ultimately, leads to increased susceptibility to morbidity and mortality. Unsurprisingly, over 85% of people over 75 years of age suffer from chronic diseases. Notwithstanding, healthcare systems, usually organized for acute conditions, are not structured to provide effective and efficient care for chronic conditions. Patients with chronic conditions often present a complex interplay of multimorbidity, polypharmacy and frailty. These determinants of health, which are tightly intertwined, are further modulated and influenced by several characteristics of patients, including sex, socio-economic factors and the broad spectrum of the so - called gender-related characteristics of the individuals. The combination of these determinants - whose interaction is often unpredictable - contribute to defining the prognosis of these patients.

Frailty is proposed as a state of increased vulnerability and strongly characterizes the older population (Clegg A, Lancet 2013; 381: 752-62). Nonetheless, older age does not always imply a condition of frailty. The development of a simple frailty index can be useful in clinical practice to stratify patients according to their level of frailty, taking into account the specific gender peculiarities, and may facilitate the appropriate tailoring of social- and health-related interventions. One of the factors that accelerates biological aging and increases susceptibility to frailty is a chronic, low-grade and systemic inflammation known as inflammaging. (Ferrucci L, et al. Nat Rev Cardiol 2018). Aging-associated platelet hyperreactivity is driven by chronic inflammation (Pavel Davizon-Castillo et al. Blood 2019) and is associated with chronic age-related cardiovascular disease and mortality. In turn activated platelets fuel inflammation creating a vicious cycle known as thromboinflammation. Both the hemostatic and the immune system display sexual dimorphism and are susceptible to gender-related factors, such as diet, stress, workload, etc. Identification of thromboinflammatory biomarkers could be a novel valuable asset to understand and predict frailty in a more sex and gender sensitive manner in the aging population.

Another aging feature is malnutrition, which can significantly contribute to quality of life and clinical outcomes. In particular, the age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and function (i.e.,sarcopenia) reduces the autonomy of older adults, impinges on their quality of life and reduces the tolerance to chronic as well acute therapeutic interventions. Recent evidence suggests that sarcopenia could be considered as a proxy for biological age (Mandelblatt et al. JAMA Oncol 2021). Therefore, timely diagnosis and treatment of impending malnutrition and sarcopenia could ameliorate not only patients' quality of life but survival as well (Bargetzi L et al. Ann Oncol 2021). Sarcopenia and inflammation are associated with osteoarthritis, the most common degenerative joint disease and a leading cause of frailty and disability in the elderly (Wang H, et al. Plos One 2022). The frailty Index (alone or associated with biomarkers) may not include all factors that impact life expectancy yet. It is a well-described clinical phenomenon that females live longer than males yet tend to experience greater levels of co-morbidity and disability. Gender-sensitive factors may be relevant in this context. Expectations and responsibilities associated with gender roles may contribute to the willingness (and ability) of the sexes to adopt a ""sick"" role, seek help and access to health care (Hibbard JH, et al. Women Health 1986). While social vulnerability is weakly to moderately correlated with frailty in both sexes, females are more socially vulnerable than males due to their living situation (widowhood and living alone) (Andrew MK, et al. BMC Geriatrics 2014). Even so, females may be better able to cope with higher levels of frailty due to greater social support networks.

Males may be more vulnerable to the effects of social isolation, particularly widowhood, both in terms of frailty and mortality (Shor E, et al. Demography 2012). In conclusion, clinical, biological, social and behavioral factors (captured by gender) may contribute to the frailty burden. To date, few studies have presented frailty scores stratified by sex and, overall, results have not been consistent (Gordon EH, et al. Maturitas 2018). Appropriate tailoring of social- and health-related interventions is critical to reduce potential harm from inappropriate procedures and maximize benefits from therapeutic intervention in such a complex population. Stratification of patients based on their gender and frailty status has the potential to tailor their care more precisely, shift the emphasis in medicine from reaction to prevention and reduce the health cost burden.",Aging Frailty

Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by impaired endothelium-dependent dilation and is primarily caused by reduced nitric oxide bioavailability secondary to oxidative stress and inflammation. Interventions that improve endothelial dysfunction are important for improving endothelial function and reducing CVD risk in this high-risk population. Aronia melanocarpa, commonly known as aronia berries or chokeberries, are rich in polyphenols such as anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids. These compounds, and derivatives resulting from gut microbial and phase II metabolism, have been shown to attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation, and to improve endothelial function. Aronia berries and other berries have been shown in numerous studies to have diverse cardiometabolic health effects including modulation of endothelial function, arterial stiffness, blood pressure, oxidative stress, and inflammation. In addition, berries, dietary fiber, polyphenols have been shown to exert positive effects on the gut microbiota, which may mediate improvements in cardiovascular health. Recently, we have demonstrated that modulation of the gut microbiota is associated with improvements in vascular dysfunction. The primary goal of the currently proposed research is to assess the efficacy and dose-dependent response of an aronia full spectrum dietary supplement to improve endothelial function in middle-aged/older men and postmenopausal women. A secondary goal is to determine whether aronia full spectrum modulation of the gut microbiota is associated with improvements in endothelial function.

The investigators propose a strategy for treatment of elderly HIV-infected patients with a double impact on systemic inflammation and age-related co-morbidities by switching the protease inhibitors by raltegravir, a integrase inhibitor with a neutral effect on lipid and bone metabolism, and adding an statin because of their anti-inflammatory effect. For safety reasons, only patients with maintained viral suppression (documented indetectable viral load for 1 year or more), and no history of virological failure to integrase inhibitors or suspected or documented resistance mutations to the integrase or retrotranscriptase will be candidates for the study.

Several studies suggest a non-linear decay of these age-related changes. Denervation-reinnervation processes, resulting in fewer but larger surviving motor units in advanced age, start as early as age 50-60yr and can be magnified in older adults (\>75yr). Significant functional consequences in daily living activities are not usually observed until approximately 50yr. However, after 50yr, muscle strength/power reduction is accelerated and becomes faster than average muscle mass loss. Most observations come from cross- sectional studies and several confounding factors associated with secondary aging, such as physical activity levels, may contribute to (or compensate for) the observed age-related reductions in neuromuscular function. Compared to cross-sectional designs, prospective ones are advantageous in their ability to investigate fundamental mechanisms by excluding inter-subjects variability. In this project, the investigators will characterize longitudinal age-related changes in motor function, physical performance and muscle aerobic metabolism with an integrated approach.

Regular aerobic exercise (AE) benefits vascular function in older men by reducing oxidative stress, however, similar AE training improvements are diminished or absent in postmenopausal women. not using estrogen-based hormone therapy. Vascular function and oxidative stress are improved with AE training in postmenopausal women treated with E2, suggesting an essential role of E2 in vascular adaptations to AE in women. Clinical use of E2 is contraindicated for this purpose, thus establishing alternative pharmacological approaches that could be administered as a substitute for E2 to improve AE signaling for vascular benefits and reducing CVD risk in E2-deficient postmenopausal women is biomedically important. The mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant MitoQ may be an alternative to E2 for restoring AE benefits in E2-deficient postmenopausal women given its recently established effectiveness for reducing oxidative stress and improving vascular function in that population. Accordingly, the overall aim of this application is to assess the efficacy of a 12-week randomized controlled trial of moderate intensity AE training combined with oral MitoQ (20 mg/d) compared to AE+oral placebo (PL) or No AE+MitoQ on vascular vasodilatory function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation; FMD) in healthy E2-deficient postmenopausal women.

These age-related chronic diseases are associated with metabolic disturbances and mitochondrial dysfunction in humans. Nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) levels play an important role in energy metabolism and mitochondrial functioning and indeed it has been shown that high concentrations of NAD+ as well as a high NAD+/NADH ratio are strongly associated with metabolic and mitochondrial health. In contrast, decreased NAD+ bioavailability is reported in both ageing and obese humans as well as in diabetic mice. These findings fueled the idea of influencing NAD+ bioavailability in order to improve metabolic disturbances and mitochondrial dysfunction in humans. Supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR), a naturally occurring form of vitamin B3, may provide a way to boost cellular NAD+ levels. However, in contrast to animal studies, NR supplementation in humans has so far been unsuccessful in improving skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, exercise capacity or insulin sensitivity. Recently, it has been suggested that a situation where NAD+ levels become limited, is needed for NR supplementation to exert beneficial health effects.

mitochondria,mitochondria aging,NCT04264897,Antecedent Metabolic Health and Metformin Aging Study,COMPLETED,PHASE3,"Aging is the number one risk factor for the majority of chronic diseases. There are no pharmaceutical treatments to slow aging and prolong healthspan. The anti-diabetic drug metformin is considered a likely pharmaceutical candidate to slow aging. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that metformin treatment in subjects free of type 2 diabetes will improve insulin sensitivity and glucoregulation in insulin resistant individuals, but will decrease insulin sensitivity and glucoregulation in insulin sensitive subjects. Further, the investigators hypothesize that long-term metformin treatment will remodel mitochondria in a way that decreases mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin sensitive, but improves mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin resistant. The investigators will use a dual-site, 12- week drug intervention trial performed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner on 148 subjects recruited from two separate sites (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) and University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWM)). After consent and initial subject screening for chronic disease, subjects will be stratified to insulin sensitive (IS) or insulin resistant (IR) groups. Over a 12- week intervention, half of each group will take metformin and half will take a placebo. Pre- and post--intervention, subjects will complete a series of procedures to assess insulin sensitivity, glucose regulation, and biomarkers of aging. The same subjects will provide a skeletal muscle biopsy pre-- and post-intervention to assess the change in mitochondrial function and mitochondrial remodeling with and without metformin treatment. By completion of this project, the investigators expect to provide evidence that helps further delineate who may benefit from metformin treatment to slow aging.","Aging, Insulin Sensitivity, Chronic Disease, Mitochondria, Insulin Resistance"

In animal studies, NR, which is converted to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), has shown potential as a neuroprotective agent, with indications of protection against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's dementia, and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, aging is commonly associated with decreased tissue NAD levels, a phenomenon linked to premature aging and a spectrum of age-related disorders, including cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Existing preclinical and clinical research highlights the promise of NAD replenishment through enhanced DNA repair, sirtuin activity, and improved mitochondrial function. The research center has conducted two phase II clinical trials on NR for Parkinson's disease (NAD-PARK and NR-SAFE), administering up to 3000 mg of NR daily. These trials have shown promising results, indicating NR's potential as a treatment that may alter the course of the disease and possibly as neuroprotective treatment in Parkinson's disease.

The NAD age trial primarily aims to determine:

* The efficacy of NAD therapy in improving clinical symptoms of frailty, evaluated through standardized physical and cognitive function tests.
* The safety of administering 2000 mg NR daily in an elderly frail population.

mitochondria,mitochondria aging,NCT04851288,Mitochondrial-targeted Antioxidant Supplementation for Improving Age-related Vascular Dysfunction in Humans,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,PHASE2,"The majority of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) occur in men and women ≥60 years of age. Vascular dysfunction, including endothelial dysfunction, as assessed by reduced endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD), and stiffening of the large elastic arteries (i.e., aortic and carotid artery stiffening), is a major mechanism of increased risk of CVD in older adults. Excess production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) by mitochondria (mtROS) has emerged as a central feature of vascular oxidative stress with aging and driver of age-related vascular dysfunction. As such, identifying novel strategies to decrease mtROS and improve vascular function, to ultimately reduce the risk of age-related CVD, is an important biomedical objective.

MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that accumulates at the inner mitochondrial membrane where it is optimally positioned to reduce mtROS. Preclinical findings showed that 4 weeks of oral MitoQ supplementation completely restored EDD in old mice, ameliorated mtROS-associated suppression of EDD, and was associated with reduced arterial mtROS, oxidative stress, and improved mitochondrial health. MitoQ therapy also reduced aortic stiffness in old mice. A recent small pilot study of older adults (n=20) found that supplementation with MitoQ was well-tolerated, improved endothelial function, and reduced plasma levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, a circulating biomarker of oxidative stress. Consistent with the preclinical findings, preliminary mechanistic assessments in subsets of subjects from the pilot study suggested that improved endothelial function with MitoQ was mediated by reduced endothelial cell mtROS production, associated reductions in tonic mtROS-related suppression of EDD, and improved mitochondrial health, linked in part to changes in circulating factors in the serum induced by chronic MitoQ supplementation. Lastly, MitoQ reduced aortic stiffness in older adults who exhibited age-related aortic stiffening at baseline.

The investigators are conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to establish oral MitoQ (20 mg/day; MitoQ, Ltd.) for 3 months vs. placebo (n=56/group) for improving endothelial function in older men and women (≥60 years), and determine the mechanisms by which MitoQ improves endothelial function.

Our study will analyze whether an intervention consisting of a multicomponent training programme applied to patients over the age of 60 who are hospitalized for acute medical conditions in an Oncology Department of a tertiary hospital improves functional capacity and cognitive function. A total of 50 hospitalized older adult patients will be recruited in the Hospital Universitario de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.

The intervention consists of a multicomponent exercise training programme that will take place for 3 consecutive days (2 sessions/day). The control group will receive usual hospital care, which will include physical rehabilitation when needed. Functional and cognitive impairment after and during acute hospitalization in older adults are major determinants of the later need for health resources.

It leverages advanced multiparametric brain and spinal cord imaging at high (3T) and ultra-high magnetic fields (7T) to assess structural, functional, metabolic, and mesoscale changes in the central nervous system (CNS). Particular emphasis is placed on sodium (23Na-MRI) and phosphorus (31P-MRI) imaging, along with layer-dependent brain connectivity analysis.

The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of neuronal energy failure, measured via sodium concentration, on functional and structural reorganization in both healthy individuals and patients with various neurological conditions. Directed brain network models will be constructed from MRI data to quantify the connectivity strength (in- and out-degree) of cortical nodes. These connectivity metrics will be correlated with sodium concentrations to assess energy failure and its role in network reorganization. Longitudinal follow-up over two years is planned for subgroups with clinically progressive diseases.

Secondary objectives include decoding metabolic, microstructural, and functional signatures of successful aging at the laminar level; characterizing disease-specific patterns of cortical and spinal microstructure associated with physical and cognitive dysfunction; describing longitudinal mesoscale and metabolic changes; and generating representative normative imaging datasets for the neuroscience community.

telomeres,telomeres aging,NCT00988611,Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Predictors Study,COMPLETED,,"The goals of this research proposal are to further our understanding of the reproductive aging process in women and to improve our ability to clinically assess and model reproductive aging. Reproductive aging is a continuous process that begins many years prior to menopause. Women in their late 30s and early 40s usually maintain normal menstrual function and ovulatory status, yet fertility in these women is considerably compromised compared to younger women. The primary mechanism of reproductive aging is through the process of ovarian primordial follicle (egg) depletion, a process that exhibits considerable variation between women. As a result, the age at which an individual begins to experience infertility and menstrual cycle changes secondary to follicle depletion also varies significantly and is difficult to predict. The clinical assessment of the number of primordial follicles remaining in the ovary has traditionally relied upon the measurement of ovarian or pituitary hormones such as FSH, estradiol, and inhibin B. Unfortunately, these measures are all indirect and poorly sensitive in the assessment of ovarian reserve. More recently, serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and the ovarian antral follicle count have been utilized as clinical measures of ovarian reserve. Both have been correlated with chronological age and have some predictive power in determining stimulation quantity (the number of oocytes obtained at the time of egg-recovery) in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment cycles. Reproductive aging in women; however, is more than just the depletion of oocytes from a woman's ovaries, but also involves a decline in oocyte quality. The predictive value of these clinical markers of ovarian reserve with regards to oocyte quality is unknown. Additionally, new tools developed to assess biological aging in other organ systems such as white blood cell telomere length and the measurement of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) through skin autofluorescence have not been evaluated with respect to the reproductive aging process.

autophagy,autophagy aging,NCT06633198,"Heat, Microvascular Function and Aging",RECRUITING,EARLY_PHASE1,"Vascular dysfunction is a common factor in many chronic debilitating diseases, contributing to morbidity and mortality. With the onset of chronic disease or exposure to stress, the vasculature displays an inability to adequately respond to increased blood flow demands, manifesting in a reduced ability or altered mechanism of vasodilation. Aging is an independent risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, and reduces vasodilator capacity, or alters the mechanism by which vasodilation occurs in multiple vascular beds. Chronic exercise/physical activity is one of the most potent ways to enhance vascular function, resulting in favorable outcomes such as reductions in blood pressure, and improved ability to perform activities of daily living. Barriers to exercise or failure of long-term adherence preclude many populations from the cardiovascular benefits of exercise, thus further enhancing cardiovascular risk. Avenues to mimic blood flow patterns observed with exercise may exert beneficial effects without the need for the ability to exercise. Recent evidence has demonstrated that passive heat therapy, or chronic heat exposure (\~ +1°C in core temperature) results in reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, blood pressure and improved large artery endothelial function, primarily through preservation of large artery function in response to vascular stress. It is unclear whether microvascular function is augmented in response to acute heat exposure, or whether this can protect against vascular insults particularly in older adults. Some preliminary evidence in humans suggest that autophagy, a cell recycling process is involved in the beneficial cardiovascular effects, as short-term heat exposure upregulates markers of autophagy. Previous evidence from our lab indicates that autophagy governs the mechanism by which microvascular vasodilation occurs.

Interestingly, the dramatic changes that the human body undergoes due to bedrest for illnesses and hospitalization are similar to those seen over decades of normal aging. Bedrest in otherwise healthy older individuals can lead to a reduction of muscle size and strength, changes in bone strength and function of the heart and blood vessels. Bedrest can also lead to changes in keeping proper balance as well as changes in processing and understanding information. All of these factors negatively affect activities of daily living leading to physical function impairment and development of frailty, a clinical condition associated with an increased risk for disease and death.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether exercise can counteract the negative effects of 2-week head tilt down bed rest on muscle function and metabolism, postural control, bone structure, orthostatic tolerance and cognitive function in adults.

For this study the investigators will recruit 24 healthy men and women between 55 - 65 years of age.

The age-associated increased risk of cardiovascular disease is due, in large part, to the development of arterial dysfunction, including endothelial dysfunction and stiffening of the large elastic arteries. Therefore, novel, effective interventions that improve arterial function will have a large public health impact by decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

The short-chain fatty acid acetate is endogenously produced by the gut microbiome from fermentation of dietary soluble fiber. High-fiber diets reduce risk of cardiovascular diseases, but unfortunately, a low percentage of Americans meet guidelines for adequate dietary fiber intake and, despite nationwide efforts to improve this, trends in fiber intake have not improved over the last 20+ years. Thus, directly supplementing acetate may be a more practical and feasible intervention for effectively improving arterial function in older adults and reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

The investigators will conduct a study to determine the efficacy of 12 weeks of oral supplementation with acetate for improving arterial function in late middle-aged and older (50+ years) adults. They will also assess the safety and tolerability of acetate supplementation in these adults and perform innovative mechanistic analyses to determine how acetate supplementation improves arterial function.

Therefore, maintaining a deep, stable and consistent sleep is very important for a good quality of life. Aging is often related to a decrease in the ability to fall asleep and maintain sleep. Getting older, various factors can worsen the normal sleep process, which is essential for restoring function and body function. Aging-related diseases, life changes, or own aging can disrupt the normal sleep cycle and seriously affect healthy aging. For example, the circadian rhythm and sleep consolidation will be broken with normal aging. These changes may lead to aging, or become part of the risk factors for diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. How to avoid disability and dementia by improving the quality of sleep to make the elderly healthy and aging, will bring huge effects to the economy, society, and health care.

From this plan, investigators will participate in an integrated plan (main plan)-"" Integrating Systematic Data of Geriatric Medicine to Explore the Solution for Healthy Aging"". In the main plan, 500 subjects will be enrolled. All subjects consent to provide medical record and will be tested for sarcopenia, including body composition, 4-meter walk, handgrip strength. The subjects screened sleep-affected subjects. It is estimated that 250 people will be invited for home sleep testing, such as continuous positive pressure breathing aid (CPAP) for sleep apnea (OSA) (approximately 120 subjects). For non-OSA and non-periodic limb movement disorder (PLMS) sleep problems, take a phototherapy program (about 60 subjects). The following goals are expected to be achieved:

1. Link to the main project to explore the correlation between common sleep disorders in the elderly and blood pressure, cognition, sarcopenia, metabolomics or intestinal microbiome

There is good evidence already that nutrition can delay the development of cognitive decline in ageing, in particular for ageing-sensitive brain regions such as the medial temporal lobe, however this has been little explored for cranberry intake. Cranberries are high in plant-derived nutrients called polyphenols, which have been suggested to promote brain function and protect against disease-causing mechanisms.

microbiome,microbiome aging,NCT07054645,Elderberry Functional Gum and Cognitive & Oral Health in Older Adults,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,"Globally, the aging population is increasing rapidly, leading to a dramatic rise in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by pathological hallmarks such as β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque accumulation, tau protein aggregation, synaptic loss, and widespread neuroinflammation. These processes impair key cognitive domains including attention, memory, executive function, and orientation, hindering independent daily functioning.

Beyond cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases are associated with a marked deterioration in oromotor functions, such as chewing and swallowing. Mastication plays a critical role not only in digestion but also in neuro-sensory stimulation. Trigeminal nerve signaling activated by chewing enhances neurotransmitter release, boosts neurotrophic factor production (e.g., BDNF), and facilitates Aβ clearance, thereby supporting synaptic plasticity and reducing inflammation. Neuroimaging studies have shown that a higher number of functional occlusal pairs is associated with increased gray and white matter volume in regions affected early in Alzheimer's disease.

Systematic reviews have identified poor mastication and tooth loss as risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. Mechanistically, loss of afferent input from the oral cavity-due to tooth loss, reduced chewing force, prosthetic use, or muscle atrophy-leads to reduced brain stimulation, diminished neurotrophic support, and impaired cerebral blood flow. Thus, geriatric-friendly chewing gum formulations with low elasticity and ease of chewing have been recommended.

Chewing gum is a promising vehicle for functional compounds due to its potential for transmucosal absorption and cognitive stimulation. Randomized controlled trials have shown that both active and inactive gums improve attention and reduce error rates in cognitive tasks, highlighting the beneficial effects of mastication.

Another emerging target for cognitive enhancement is the oral microbiota, a complex ecosystem of over 700 bacterial species. Dysbiosis in this ecosystem has been linked to neurological outcomes via inflammatory and neurotoxic pathways. Certain pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, have been detected in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Moreover, metagenomic studies have shown that reduced salivary microbial diversity correlates with poorer cognitive performance, even in young adults.

Elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) is rich in anthocyanins (e.g., cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside) with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Literature shows that polyphenols can be absorbed via buccal and sublingual mucosa, bypassing first-pass metabolism and providing faster systemic effects. However, the impact of anthocyanin-enriched chewing gum on oral microbiota and cognitive function has not yet been systematically investigated.

This study aims to develop and evaluate a geriatric-friendly functional chewing gum enriched with standardized elderberry anthocyanins. The intervention targets dual mechanisms-neurophysiological and microbial-to support cognitive health and balance oral microbiota in older adults.","Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Aging, Oral Microbiome"

Under physiological stress either due to the development of a disease such as diabetes or simply from aging, the endothelial cells can be impacted and become dysfunctional thereby impairing their ability to make NO and even promote the development of blood clots. When such endothelial dysfunction occurs, it may be a precursor for the future development of cardiovascular (CV) disease like hypertension or even coronary artery disease later on in life in these patients. Therefore, the ability to somehow enhance the local production or availability of NO within such affected blood vessels in patients identified as prone to endothelial dysfunction could play a positive role in either preventing or delaying the onset of endothelial dysfunction and subsequent CV disease in such patients.

metabolism,metabolism aging,NCT06000605,Brain Substrate Switch to Ketones and Lactate,UNKNOWN,,"The brain is constantly active and energetically expensive, making up a quarter of the body's energy budget despite occupying only 2% of its mass. To fuel this incessant activity, the brain relies on glucose, which accommodates 99% of its metabolic needs. In most cases, glucose is the ideal fuel since it is in constant surplus owing to 24-hr access to sugar-rich food. However, the brain is metabolically flexible and capable of metabolizing alternative fuels when glucose is scarce, or, decreasing rapidly. For example, during fasting when glucose stores are dwindling, ketone bodies can supplement the brain's metabolic needs. During intense exercise, when glucose stores are being rapidly depleted, lactate - a byproduct of this glucose turnover - similarly acts as an alternative fuel for the brain. In healthy individuals, exploiting this 'brain metabolic flexibility' may be beneficial in protecting the brain from aging.

The main question is: Does the brain substrate switch that occurs during fasting and high-intensity exercise underlie the beneficial effects on the brain?

Young, healthy participants will fast for 3 days and complete high-intensity cycling exercise, each of which will induce a brain substrate switch. Participants will also be passively infused with ketones (to simulate fasting) and lactate (to simulate high-intensity exercise) in the fed and rested state. In doing so, the investigators will isolate the brain substrate switch from the broader, pluripotent stressors that encompass fasting and exercise.

The merging of culinary knowledge and nutritional education has been coined under the term Culinary Medicine.

The present project is presented as an innovative strategy to improve dietary habits of overweight/obese people. To this end, volunteers will participate in an intervention that will be based on cooking workshops and nutritional education. In this sense, participants will receive different cooking and nutritional education sessions in order to be able to give them resources to cook in an easy, enjoyable and healthy way.

The study will evaluate the effect that this nutritional-culinary intervention programme might exert on health and will compare these results with the effects obtained providing a more traditional nutritional education.

The potential effects will be evaluated through the measurement of specific biochemical parameters related to the most prevalent chronic diseases ( insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, among others). In addition, the measurement of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in tissue will be carried out.

It is associated with functional changes in the resting brain activity, brain morphology, plasticity, complexity and function. Moreover, aging is the main risk factor for neurodegenerative disease.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the age-related neurophysiological changes and identifying novel biomarkers of healthy brain ageing is thus instrumental for the development of efficient interventions against age-related motor/cognitive impairments. Within this context, there is now a significant literature establishing the enhanced efficacy of secreted exosomes over the stem cells from which they are derived when used as a possible treatment for neurodegenerative disorders. Exosomes are a subgroup of extracellular vesicles which regulate intercellular communication and, unlike stem cells, easily cross into the brain and can be administered in non-syngeneic species without immune rejection.

Studies on brain ageing in humans has major limitation in the lack of accessibility of the central nervous system. EEG has allowed the non-invasive assessment of functional changes in the aging brain. In fact, this technique can provide a direct assessment of neural activity and information flow with a higher temporal resolution that is particularly important for investigating the dynamics of brain changes underlying cognitive processing and age-related changes, providing novel biomarkers of brain aging that could be used to unveil differences between healthy and unhealthy processes particularly in the pre-symptomatic and pre-clinical stage.

Vascular-aging is accompanied by a gradual remodeling affecting both cardiac and arterial walls. Arterial hypertension, an established cardiovascular risk factor, has been suggested to exert pro-inflammatory actions threw several biological mediators enhancing arterial stiffness. Both effects of aging and hypertension are associated with higher levels of arterial stiffness, but their respective role is not well established in the pathophysiology of arterial stiffening.

Few data are available neither on the real anatomic aortic impact of aging and hypertension on aortic compliance and ventricular function and its relationship to arterial stiffness assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, nor on the reliability of cine phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging arterial stiffness measurements.

Recent studies using positron emission tomography imaging (PET) with 18 F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been advocated as a means of measuring arterial wall inflammation in various population referred for oncology staging. FDG uptake is correlated with the number of cardiovascular risk factors and even the risk of future cardiovascular events. This method, combined with X-ray computed tomography (CT), has also demonstrated that aortic calcifications quantified by CT and local signs of inflammation detected by FDG uptake contribute to arterial stiffness. A strong relationship between large vessels stiffening assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity measurement, aortic calcifications quantified by CT and inflammation evaluated by FDG uptake has been demonstrated.

Therefore, in the current study, we use FDG PET associated to CT to characterize aortic inflammation and aortic calcifications coupled to pulse wave velocity measurement and cardiac function in elderly individuals.

In fact, if vascular aging promoting a local inflammatory process is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, then vascular changes assessed by non-invasive vascular imaging (MRI,FDG PET) could represent a potential target for treatment and prevention Thirty individuals ≥ 65 years of age were examined, 15 hypertensive subjects and 15 controls.

* a group of endurance-trained seniors (age range 65 - 75 year old, n=15) ● a group of sedentary seniors (age range 65 - 75 year old, n=15)
* a group of well endurance-trained young men (age range 20 - 30 year old, n=15) ● a group of sedentary young men (age range 20 - 30 year old, n=15).

Subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria:

1. for athletes' groups: defined as more than 150 minutes of running activity per week; for young athletes at least 3 years and for master athletes at least 15 years history of running.
2. for groups less active than recommended: no history of regular physical activity training and no more practice than 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity per week.

inflammation,inflammation aging,NCT02629666,Exercise Referral Schemes Enhanced by Self-Management Strategies to Battle Sedentary Behaviour,COMPLETED,,"The increase of the elderly population leads to increased prevalence of frailty, risk for poor health outcomes, and related health and social care costs. Lack of physical activity (PA) and established sedentary behaviours (SB) constitute an additional burden, as they are related to progression of chronic disease and disabling conditions. An existing initiative to battle SB and insufficient PA levels are exercise referral schemes (ERS) implemented in primary care, where insufficiently active individuals are referred to a third party service (sports centre or leisure facility) that prescribes and monitors an exercise programme tailored to the patients' needs. ERS had shown improvements in PA in the short-term, but may have limited power to change SB and produce long-term effects. Thus, ERS might be enhanced by self-management strategies (SMS) to promote behavioural change. Such strategies based on social cognitive theory have been shown to increase self-confidence, power to act, and involvement in exercise. In a first stage, a systematic review, focus groups and a feasibility study will be conducted. Then, a three-armed pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) will assess the long-term effectiveness (18-month follow-up) of a complex intervention on sedentary behaviour (SB) in an elderly population, based on existing ERS enhanced by self-management strategies (SMS). It will be compared to ERS alone and to general recommendations plus two educational sessions. The RCT will include 1338 subjects and will have a follow up of 18 months. The effect on SB will be measured as sitting time and the number of minutes spent in activities requiring ≤ 1.5 Metabolic Equivalent Tasks, and PA as daily counts per minute and intensity of exercise, and daily step counts. Secondary outcomes will include: physical function, healthcare use and costs, anthropometry, bioimpedance, blood pressure, self-rated health and quality of life, activities of daily living, anxiety, depressive symptoms, social network, physical activity self-regulation, self-efficacy for exercise, disability, fear of falling, loneliness, executive function, and physical fatigue.

Moreover, the rate of mucin synthesis has been demonstrated to be directly related to the availability of dietary threonine in healthy rats (2) and piglets (3,4). Intestinal inflammation is known to increase gastrointestinal threonine uptake and mucin synthesis in enterally fed minipigs (5). Additionally, in animals, mucin function/barrier has been shown to decline with age, leaving them more susceptible to bacterial penetration. Thus, with advancing age (6), a higher dietary supply of threonine may be needed for maintaining intestinal mucosal health.

Cognition and locomotion are two human abilities controlled by the brain. Their decline is highly prevalent with physiological and pathological aging, and is greater than the simple sum of their respective prevalence, suggesting a complex age-related interplay between cognition and locomotion. Both declines in cognition and locomotion are associated, furthermore the temporal nature of their association has been unclear for a long time. Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis has provided evidence that poor gait performance predicts dementia and, in particular, has demonstrated that MCR syndrome is a pre-dementia syndrome, suggesting that low gait performance is the first symptom of dementia. The uniqueness of MCR syndrome is that it does not rely on a complex evaluation or laboratory investigations. Indeed, this syndrome combined subjective cognitive complaint and objective slow gait speed, and is easy to apply in population-based settings.

Prevalence and incidence of MCR syndrome, as well as its association with incidence of cognitive decline and impairment, have never been reported in Canada.

Both conditions are associated with an increased risk of death, functional decline, and health care costs. The presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the central nervous system has detrimental effects on the regulation of neurotransmitter signaling in different areas of the brain, especially the hippocampus, ultimately resulting in neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. Neuroimaging studies have provided important information on the structural and functional networks involved in the pathogenesis of POD and POCD. Strong evidence has shown a decrease in the integrity of the default mode network (DMN), along a continuum from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with sedative and analgesic properties but minimal respiratory effects. Several studies have shown that dexmedetomidine reduces serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and POCD. The expected results are to analyze the change in the integrity of the DMN from the preoperative period to the first weeks after discharge given by the two anesthetic strategies (SEVO vs SEVODEX). In addition, it seeks to evaluate (1) Changes in the integrity of the DMN at 3 months. (2) Modulation of structural changes in white matter integrity as measured by DTI. (3) Patient performance in specific cognitive function tests and serum inflammation biomarkers between the pre- and postoperative period. For the analysis, the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) will be used, in which the integrity of the DMN is the dependent variable.

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) increase with age and is a key intermediary factor linking aging to increased CVD risk. The primary mechanisms underlying the age-associated increase in SBP is stiffening of the large elastic arteries, which is mediated by increases in oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular smooth muscle tone. Regular caloric restriction is effective at lowering SBP in middle-aged and older adults; however, adherence to caloric restriction is poor and may be detrimental to normal weight older adults due to reduced skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral density. Therefore, identification of more practical alternative interventions that mimic the beneficial effects of caloric restriction, with stronger adherence and less risk of adverse consequences, is of significant biomedical importance.

Nicotinamide riboside is a naturally occurring precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a critical mediator of the beneficial effects of caloric restriction, and therefore a novel caloric restriction mimetic compound. We recently completed the first pilot study of nicotinamide riboside supplementation in healthy middle-aged and older adults and demonstrated that 6 weeks of supplementation decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 8 mmHg in individuals with baseline SBP of 120-139 mmHg (elevated SBP/stage 1 hypertension) compared with placebo, and lowered arterial stiffness, a strong independent predictor of CVD and related morbidity and mortality.

As a next translational step, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to further assess the safety and efficacy of oral nicotinamide riboside (3 months vs placebo) for decreasing SBP and arterial stiffness in middle-aged and older men and women with SBP between 120 and 139 mmHg at baseline.","Hypertension, Aging"

Before and after a 10-12 week High Intensity Interval Exercise training program subjects will undergo several tests including: 1) a maximal treadmill test, 2) an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, 3) muscle biopsy, 4) body composition, 5) several physical function tests and 6) other health related measures including lung function, arterial stiffness and several blood measures (e.g. liver enzymes, kidney function).

DATA ANALYSES \& SAFETY ISSUES: As there are no comparison groups, data analyses will consist of performing paired t-tests on pre and post exercise training values for each of the measurement variables of interest.

inflammation,inflammation aging,NCT05135234,Developing a Physiological Understanding of High Duration Activity,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,"When muscles are not contracting, the local energy demand by muscle and use of specific fuels used to produce energy by oxidative metabolism are minimal. The time people spend sitting inactive (sedentary time) typically comprises more than half of the day. This sedentary behavior is associated with elevated risk of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, some cancers, and multiple conditions leading to poor aging.

From a progressive series of experiments, the driving goal is to develop a physiological method for sustaining contractile activity via oxidative metabolism over more time than is possible by traditional exercise (hours, not minutes per day).

Developing a physiological method suitable of prolonged muscular activity for ordinary people (who are often unfit) requires gaining fundamental insights about muscle biology and biomechanics. This also entails a careful appreciation of the ability to isolate specific muscles in the leg during controlled movements, such as the soleus muscle during isolated plantarflexion. This includes quantifying specific biological processes that are directly responsive to elevated skeletal muscle recruitment. The investigators will focus on movement that is safe and practical for ordinary people to do given their high amount of daily sitting time.

This includes developing methods to optimally raise muscle contractile activity, in a way that is not limited by fatigue, and is feasible throughout as many minutes of the day as possible safely. This also requires development of methodologies to quantify specific muscular activity, rather than generalized body movement.

There is a need to learn how much people can increase muscle metabolism by physical activity that is perceived to them as being light effort. It is important to learn if this impacts systemic metabolic processes under experimental conditions over a short term time span in order to avoid confounding influences of changes in body weight or other factors.","Sedentary Lifestyle, Hyperinsulinemia, Glucose Tolerance Impaired, Low-density-lipoprotein-type, Aging Problems, Lipid Metabolism Disorders, Inactivity, Physical, Metabolic Disorder, Glucose"

In order to prevent disabling diseases and improve the quality of life, it is necessary to understand the conditions related to the health of this specific population. One of the known alterations that occur in the body is the increased low-grade systemic inflammatory process, anabolic resistance, and muscle catabolism. These conditions can negatively interfere with muscle quality and functionality. However, the maintenance of the metabolic and physical functionality of muscle tissue can be preserved by performing physical exercises throughout life because of its anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In the present study, a multicomponent training program that combines aerobic, strength, balance, and flexibility capacities was used.

inflammation,inflammation aging,NCT01045512,"The Role of the ""Inflammatory/ Pathogen Burden"" for Cardiac Ageing",TERMINATED,PHASE2,"In the elderly a chronic basal systemic inflammation prevails - which is evident by enhanced CRP or IL-6 plasma concentrations - and by compromised defense mechanisms against invading microbes. These alterations belong to the physiological ageing process of the immune system (immunosenescence) and are regarded as an inflammatory response towards lifelong antigen stress (""inflammatory/pathogen burden""). This lifelong antigen stress evokes an age-dependent basal inflammatory activation of innate immunity as well as a wasting of specific immunity: it is supposed that in the course of life-time due to a multitude of infectious/inflammatory events (""multiple hits"") an inflammatory stress prevails or ""inflammatory/pathogen burden"" accumulates, which substantially contributes to an enhancement of the inflammatory parameters of natural immune response. Such enhanced inflammatory parameters characterize persons at increased risk of degenerative diseases like atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease. The risk is the higher, the higher the ""pathogen burden"". An impact of the inflammatory load on cardiac ageing has not yet been described.

""CARDIAC AGEING"", REFLECTED BY A NARROWING OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY: The physiological ageing process of the heart goes along with a narrowing of heart rate variability as shown by various groups, including our own. Arguments in favour of a causal relationship between inflammation and cardiac ageing come from an experimental study with healthy human volunteers who had received a low dose of endotoxin: such a proinflammatory stimulus leads to a reversible narrowing of heart rate variability (7). Also in senescence heart rate variability steadily declines, paralleled by a steady increase of basal inflammatory activity.

The reduction of heart rate variability also is regarded as a sensitive parameter of autonomic dysfunction, which contributes to the compromise of cardiac reserve in old age. Apart from typical morphological features and functional deterioration, e.g. diastolic dysfunction, the senescent heart is typically characterized by a narrowed heart rate variability. Efforts have been made to estimate the cardiac age of an individual by this compromised heart rate variability, which may be divergent to the biological age. In recent years diverse approaches were proposed to measure cardiac age on the basis of heart rate variability. The published mathematical formulae were mostly validated with small patient groups and have presently not entered clinical practice. Still heart rate variability is an accepted surrogate parameter of cardiac ageing and is amenable by therapeutic measures, e.g. beta-blockade.

The interaction between autonomic nervous system and inflammation is bilateral: thus vagal stimulation can improve heart rate variability and at the same time evoke anti-inflammatory action: this ""cholinergic anti-inflammatory"" reflex could make the basis for pharmacological interventions to confine overwhelming inflammatory response syndromes. The afferent vagal nerve, on the other hand, can be stimulated by inflammatory mediators and toxins (endotoxin, Interleukin-1), thus activating the efferent vagus to release acetylcholine, which can bind to a nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor on macrophages and thus interrupt cytokine release and limit the rise in the blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6). The biological meaning of this reflex is to localise inflammatory reactions in the organism and prevent a spill of cytokines to the circulation. A functioning autonomic nervous system is thus mandatory to prevent overshooting of inflammatory response to infection and non-infectious stimuli. The link between cardiac ageing and autonomic dysfunction gives another argument in favour of the notion that autonomic dysfunction and pathogen/inflammatory load could be factors promoting cardiac ageing. This, on the other hand, implies the chance of slowing down the cardiac ageing process by successfully modulating the extent of autonomic dysfunction and the scope of ""pathogen/inflammatory burden"".

THE NEED FOR A TRIAL:

A possible causal relationship between basal inflammatory activation and cardiac ageing has not been established. This is the issue of the project proposal. In this trial the investigators strive to lower the ""pathogen/ inflammatory load"" by simple and safe measures. The investigators therefore chose treatment with statins, standardised physical training (both parameters of heart function and heart rate variability could thus be improved) and vaccinations against influenza and pneumococci to prevent a further enhanced ""pathogen/ inflammatory burden"".","Aging, Inflammation"

metabolism,metabolism AND (aging OR longevity),NCT04981652,The Effect of Whole Milk to Improve Muscle Health in Older Women,COMPLETED,,"Muscle and strength begin to noticeably decline around 50 years of age, increasing an individual's risk for disease and disability. Although changes in muscle mass ultimately depend on the balance of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and breakdown (MPB) of muscle proteins, the latter remains relatively constant with aging. Accordingly, interventions that increase rates of MPS may combat long-term decrements in skeletal muscle mass and function. Previous research has established that an optimal diet to maintain muscle mass in elderly individuals requires relatively large amounts of high-quality protein to be consumed at each meal of the day. While this is a seemingly simple strategy, there are some barriers to increasing protein feeding in elderly individuals, particularly the cost of high-quality protein and, sometimes, difficulty with chewing/swallowing. Moreover, older adults often do not wish to consume large portions of protein in one meal.

Milk is a readily accessible, affordable and nutritious source of nutrient-dense high-quality protein. Consuming milk with each meal is an easy strategy to promote the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass with aging. There is also evidence suggesting that a higher fat content of milk can have a beneficial role in stimulating the MPS response to feeding, but there are insufficient data to recommend this strategy to elderly individuals.

The primary aim is to measure the rates of MPS in response to controlled diets providing whole milk, fat-free milk, or a control supplement (almond beverage - often marketed as an 'alternative' to milk) with each meal. All diets will provide equal amounts of energy, but the dairy interventions will provide more protein, reflecting the amount of protein provided by each beverage. The investigators hypothesize that rates of MPS will be highest in the whole milk group but that fat-free milk will still elicit a greater MPS than almond beverage. The investigators will conduct the comparison of beverages under habitual physical activity levels and under a brief period of increased physical activity (i.e., increased daily steps). Thus, the investigators will be able to determine whether MPS responses to the experimental beverages are increased in combination with physical activity. The results will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of daily milk ingestion for the maintenance of muscle in the elderly, increasing the marketability of milk, and potentially whole milk.","Dairy Products, Muscle Protein Synthesis, Aging, Physical Activity"

Peri-menopause (peri), typically occurs 5 yrs before menopause as hormone levels decrease. As with oestrogen, peri symptoms can affect every bodily system; e.g. depression/anxiety, diminished mental function, irregular periods, hot flushes, sleep problems, vaginal atrophy \& urinary urgency. These symptoms are linked with lower quality of life \& significantly higher work impairment; a third experiencing symptoms so severe as to impede daily life \& increase risk of suicide. Lifetime increased risks of diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis \& dementia are also associated with menopause, yet it remains disconcertingly poorly studied.

The investigators propose to create a world-first, cutting-edge, consumer-driven, Virtual peri-/menopause registry of AusTrALia (VITAL). The unique design will enable consumers to determine VITAL's questions, encourage secure revelation of private data e.g. vaginal \& mental health symptoms, \& to direct priorities for research, education, \& health service improvements. VITAL will thus deliver optimal assessments of incidence, prevalence \& impact.

The participating consumers, researchers, clinical specialists, policy makers, \& modern virtual data infrastructure enable this unique \& innovative registry design, future translation to improved community health, \& promote awareness \& collaborative synergies. Leveraging the investigators' critical range of expertise \& ongoing feedback opportunities for both participants \& stakeholder partnerships, the investigators will create a ground-breaking platform that:

* empowers the consumer voice and priorities,
* enables peri-/menopause research to extend beyond existing niche focuses,
* evidences the true impact of peri-/menopause across the nation,
* evolves healthcare services and outcomes, \&
* educates community, clinicians, \& policy-makers. After Australian registry establishment, the investigators will expand VITAL to mirror it in other nations while still protecting individual's data the right way, but so all can learn \& apply the best aspects of care from across the world.","Menopause, Perimenopausal Disorder, Postmenopausal Symptoms, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Healthy Aging, Health Care Utilization, Health Care Seeking Behavior, Mental Health Impairment, Mental Deterioration, Mental Health Issue, Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal, Diabetes Mellitus Risk, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Dementia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Menopause Related Conditions, Hot Flashes, Hot Flushes Aggravated, Economic Burden, Social Stigma"

A stiffer tendon will transmit muscle force faster, and then allow faster movement. Moreover, tendons are a living tissue and respond to mechanical forces by changing their metabolism as well as their structural and mechanical properties. The aim of the present study is to answer essential questions remaining unanswered that are necessary in order to optimize physical activity with ageing in humans, and thus improve quality of life in elderly. The main questions are: What is the minimal training intensity leading to tendon adaptations? What is the time-course of tendon adaptations? Does the same loading protocol lead to similar tendon adaptations for different tendons (Achilles vs Patellar) and does the same training program lead to identical tendon adaptations with age (25yrs vs 75yrs)? To answer these questions, tendon architecture and mechanical properties will be investigated in humans of different age and applying different training intensities. The kinematic of the tendon adaptations due to these different training characteristics will also be investigated. The training protocol will be applied on plantar flexors and knee extensors. MRI and ultrasound techniques as well as the use of ankle and knee ergometers will allow the quantification of possible modifications in tendon architecture and mechanical properties (tendon stiffness and Young's Modulus). This will be assessed in vivo, using ultrasound images to assess tendon displacement during an incremental maximal contraction.","Aging, Exercise Training, Connective Tissue, Skeletal Muscle"

Consequences of sarcopenia are, but not limited to, decreased muscle strength, frailty, and an increased risk for the development of chronic metabolic diseases. Impaired postprandial protein digestion and amino acid absorption with advancing age has been suggested to be a key mechanism underlying sarcopenia. To overcome age-related skeletal muscle atrophy, sufficient dietary protein intake is required. However, the production of animal-based protein sources, such as milk, is associated with a number of economic, environmental, and ethical issues. Accordingly, there is a need to develop sustainable dietary protein sources to support our nutrition. Mycoprotein, spirulina, chlorella, pea, and lupin are novel, sustainable, non-animal derived protein sources that may represent potential alternative protein sources. However, the efficacy of these sources to stimulate muscle mass growth in both young and older adults is unknown.

Therefore, the present study will investigate the postprandial bioavailability of mycoprotein, spirulina, chlorella, pea, and lupin protein when compared to the animal-derived milk protein. Moreover, postprandial protein handling of these novel protein sources across different ages will be assessed.

However, the loss of muscle mass beyond a certain point can make it increasingly difficult to perform activities of daily living such as rising from a chair, going up and downstairs, carrying groceries, etc. A reason why muscle mass is lost with age is that skeletal muscles become less sensitive to the growth-promoting effects of physical activity and protein ingestion. This loss of sensitivity can be overcome by consuming larger amounts of protein; however, many older adults have difficulties simply consuming greater amounts of protein from whole-food sources. Therefore, the research in this study aims to investigate how different amounts and types of protein, of either a 100%-plant-based or Lacto-vegetarian (plant-based plus dairy) protein sources, affect muscle growth.

This knowledge gap was recognized recently in the Centers for Disease Control \& Prevention and the Alzheimer's Association document ""National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health"". Our rationale for these studies is that the identification of physical exercise as a lifestyle factor able to improve cerebrovascular reserve and cognition would establish a strong scientific framework justifying design of a randomized clinical trial that could evaluate the role of physical activity in cerebrovascular health and function.

This research is based on data we obtained from a cross-sectional study that showed significant relations between physical fitness, vascular regulation and cognition. Cerebrovascular reserve and cognition were better maintained in women who were physically active but reduced in women who were sedentary. Our central hypothesis is that regular aerobic exercise mitigates age-related decreases in cerebrovascular reserve, which in turn imparts benefits in cognition. Further, we believe that these effects will persist after the structured aerobic exercise program is terminated.

Our 18 month study began with a 6-month baseline period, followed by a 6-month exercise intervention, and a 6-month follow-up period. In addition, there are 5-year and 10-year follow-up periods. Volunteers (men and women aged ≥ 55 years) from the community were recruited using a variety of recruitment methods including media and distribution lists.

It is the principal mechanism by which obesity is considered to increase the risk for type 2 diabetes and is a key feature of the metabolic syndrome. The elevated prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the older population has important consequences on the morbidity and mortality as well as on the economic burden on society. Controversy currently exists as to whether or not aging contributes to insulin resistance. Many potential factors confound the association between aging and insulin resistance, including obesity and physical inactivity.

Ectopic lipid depositions, defined as an excess accumulation of triglycerides in non adipose tissues such as in the liver (intrahepatic lipids) and within the muscle fibers (intramyocellular lipids), are positively associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the accumulation of intracellular lipids is often cited as being a key determinant in the underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance. In addition of playing an important role in obesity and type 2 diabetes, these ectopic fat depositions are also observed in common conditions such as aging and physical inactivity.

The intervention trial will test in skeletal muscle, liver and heart of sedentary obese volunteers, normal weight volunteers and masters athletes, the overall hypotheses that exercise improvement of fat oxidation capacity and/or decrease of damaging fat metabolites is a primary factor that predicts the improvement in insulin resistance.","Obesity, Physical Inactivity, Aging"

However, the large variation between individuals with regard to immune responses asks for more personalized approaches. Therefore, this field of research would benefit from a selection of those individuals with immune dysfunction. It is recently shown that immune functionality is largely dependent on intracellular metabolism, leading to the introduction of the new term 'immune cell fitness' which combines the metabolic and functional status of an immune cell. Within this study, we will determine the immune cell fitness of monocytes from healthy young adults and elderly subjects by measuring and integrating a broad range of metabolic and functional immune parameters into an immune cell fitness score. We aim to identify those individuals with immune dysfunction, the unfit. Furthermore, to identify potential nutritional strategies to improve immune cell fitness, we will study the effects of metabolites and nutrients on the immune cell fitness status of monocytes from elderly subjects.",Aging

This combination increases the risk of falls, disability, functional decline, and metabolic complications. Low levels of vitamin D are common in older adults and may contribute to reduced muscle function and poorer physical performance.

This study is designed to evaluate whether taking 10,000 International Units (IU) per day of vitamin D3 for 12 weeks can improve muscle strength and muscle mass in older adults with obesity living in southern Mexico. The study will also examine whether vitamin D3 supplementation influences body composition, physical performance, and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

Participants will complete assessments at the beginning and at the end of the 12-week period. These assessments include measurements of muscle strength, skeletal muscle mass, body fat percentage, and indicators of physical performance such as the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Additional measures of body composition and anthropometry, such as body mass index, waist circumference, and related indices, will also be recorded. Blood samples will be analyzed to determine vitamin D status.

All participants will receive daily oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) throughout the 12-week intervention. The goal of the study is to understand whether improving vitamin D status can have a positive effect on muscle health and physical function in older adults with obesity.

The burden of osteoporotic fractures in older men is substantial, and men suffer significantly worse fracture-related outcomes than women. Following a fracture, men sustain greater rates of subsequent fractures, loss of autonomy, and mortality than women and the imminent risk of re-fracture is several times higher in men than in women. Functional mobility, known to predict falls and fractures, is also notably worse in men following a fracture. In the fiscal year 2007-08, the overall annual costs of osteoporosis in Canadian men was evaluated to be $910 million.

Osteoporosis is primarily considered a disease of older women, and men are remarkably under-evaluated and under-treated for it. Recognition of sex and gender influences on skeletal health in men has been very slow; akin to the gap in cardiovascular diseases, where women are far less likely to receive guideline-recommended investigations and treatment.

Over 85% of Canadian men who suffer from fragility fractures do not receive osteoporosis screening and/or treatment strategies. The existence of this care gap in men underscores our current struggle to overcome important barriers including: 1) men's lack of awareness of the critical impact of osteoporosis and fractures on several aspects of their lives, and of the benefits of treatment; and 2) the absence of comprehensive and accessible treatments tailored to men.

Informed by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we aim to address these barriers by adapting interventions with proven efficacy to engage men at high fracture risk in health behaviour change.

The current protocol is for a pilot RCT to determine the feasibility of recruitment and retention, adherence to, and acceptability of the virtually-delivered fracture prevention intervention only.

Our long-term goal is to conduct a large pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) to address the research question: In older adults at high risk for fractures who self-identify as men, does anti-osteoporosis pharmacotherapy in conjunction with a virtually-delivered intervention that includes a gender-tailored strength training and balance based exercise program and nutritional counselling, improve functional mobility compared to anti-osteoporosis pharmacotherapy in conjunction with an attention control intervention.","Osteoporosis, Osteoporotic Fractures, Osteoporosis, Age-Related, Muscle Loss, Men, Aging"

Despite extensive research, effective pharmacological treatments for dementia remain limited, emphasising the need for early diagnosis and prevention of cognitive decline. Research suggests that lifestyle and modifiable factors account for approximately 40% of dementia risk, highlighting the potential of personalised lifestyle interventions to delay or prevent the onset of dementia. The original FINGER study demonstrated that a multi-domain lifestyle intervention simultaneously targeting dietary habits, physical and cognitive activity, as well as social interactions can effectively prevent cognitive decline and dementia.

The HUN-MLI-BRAIN trial investigates the impact of a Hungarian lifestyle intervention on brain health in older adults and is based on the FINGER multi-domain intervention. This randomised controlled study aims to maintain and enhance neurocognitive function and prevent cognitive decline in older adults through a multi-domain lifestyle program, which simultaneously targets dietary habits, physical and cognitive activity, and social engagement.

The primary goal of the HUN-MLI-BRAIN trial is to evaluate the impact of the intervention programme on neurocognitive functions and adaptive changes in large-scale brain networks at the individual level using the precision structural and functional MRI methods as well as resting-state EEG frequency-domain analyses. In addition, the influence of the intervention will be assessed in a wide range of cognitive and personal domains. The potential relationship between brain structure and function, cognitive performance, lifestyle factors, and dementia risk factors will be evaluated.

80 people without substantial cognitive impairment or dementia will be recruited into the programme in Budapest, Hungary. Participants will be randomly allocated 1:1 either to the multi-domain, folk dancing lifestyle intervention group or the self-guided, multi-domain lifestyle intervention group. The self-guided intervention encompasses multi-domain lifestyle recommendations on diet, physical and mental training, and health checks via the Polar Pacer smart watch. The folk dancing intervention includes structured, one-hour folk dancing sessions three times per week, which were specifically developed to foster physical and cognitive function whilst facilitating social interaction. Participants in this group will also receive intensive and tailored lifestyle recommendations aimed at improving physical and mental functioning. The duration of the intervention programme is 6 months. Participants will complete assessment visits before and after the intervention.

The HUN-MLI-BRAIN trial holds significant potential for advancing our understanding of how lifestyle interventions may impact brain function.

In young populations, the acute response to exercise can last hours and affect brain glucose metabolism. However, the field knows little about this acute exercise response in AD. Most exercise intervention trials designed to prevent and slow AD assess biomarkers at two fasting time points: pre- and post-intervention.

Osteopenia occurs almost simultaneously with sarcopenia in the elderly population and muscle weakness increases the risk for falls and therefore, fractures. Although these issues have been separate addressed in several studies, an integrated investigational approach to better understand the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and other age-related metabolic abnormalities and to investigate the potential role of androgens have not been undertaken in a comprehensive manner.

The program contains four independent research programs, each representing different research disciplines, and four separate cores supporting the four projects.

The main focus of the project is to determine the effect of the replacement of testosterone in elderly men and DHEA in elderly men and women and to compare these effects with placebo treatment over a two-year period.

Project 1, ""Effect of Androgen Replacement on Muscle Metabolism"" will specifically determine whether these interventions have a differential effect on size and quality of muscle in terms of strength and metabolic functions. Project 2, ""Effect of Androgen Replacement on Bone Metabolism,"" will determine the effects of this intervention on bone mineral density and markers of bone turnover.

Project 3, ""The Effect of Androgen Replacement on Carbohydrate Metabolism,"" will determine whether the age-associated decrease in circulating androgens contributes to the alterations in carbohydrate metabolism that are commonly observed in the elderly and on insulin action, insulin secretion, and glucose effectiveness.

Project 4, ""Effect of Androgen Replacement on Fat Metabolism"" will determine whether changes in fat distribution that occur with aging could result from differences in regional fatty acid uptake and systemic fatty acid kinetics, and whether these determinants of fat distribution are altered by the interventions.

An early, accurate diagnosis of AD will become increasingly important with disease-modifying therapies. Different types of fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers are available for the early detection of AD. However, implementation of routine use of these biomarkers in clinical settings is held back due to the risk of overdiagnosis, increased cost and invasiveness of the assessment method. Therefore, novel biomarkers are needed beyond the amyloid and tau pathologies for the early diagnosis of AD. Neuropsychological paper and pencil tests can detect AD and discriminate between different clinical stages. Since medial temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC), are involved in spatial navigation and degenerate in the earliest stages of AD, spatial navigation can be considered as an early cognitive biomarker of the disease. Nonetheless, the measurement of spatial navigation needs further improvement since the current paper and pencil tests lack ecological validity. Therefore, the test environment should be set up in immersive Virtual Reality (iVR). Dr. Andrea Castegnaro (Space and Memory Lab of University College of London) developed the Allocentric Spatial Update Task (ALLO task), which is an iVR task measuring egocentric and allocentric spatial abilities.

Therefore, the main objective of this study is to evaluate whether allocentric and egocentric spatial navigation, measured by the ALLO iVR task can be considered a cognitive biomarker for the early detection of AD. In addition, the investigators want to report on the neuronal correlates of both spatial navigation strategies.

Disruptions in calcium homeostasis during exercise may explain this observation, and preliminary data suggests that the mode of exercise (i.e., cycling versus treadmill) may result in different magnitudes of change in bone biomarkers. The purpose of this study is to determine if mode of exercise results in a differential bone biomarker response to an acute exercise bout in older Veterans. Blood samples will be collected before, during, and after 2 acute exercise bouts: 1) brisk treadmill walking; and 2) vigorous stationary cycling.

This allows to identify neurological diseases at an early stage of functional abnormalities, before any anatomical lesions, and to differentiate them from the ""normal"" brain aging. Aging mainly leads to atrophy with a decrease in cerebral metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, with consequent deterioration of cognitive processes, in particular executive functions (5).

In a population of 92 ""control"" subjects, investigators have already quantified the importance of the aging in frontal cortex hypometabolism. These patients were referred for a 18F-FDG PET in the follow-up of lymphoma considered to be in complete remission (PET without cerebral step), without any chemoradiotherapy within 2 months and with normal neuropsychological tests (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview MINI and Frontal Assessment Battery FAB).

However, cerebral aging can be ""accelerated"" by vascular risk factors, including increased central blood pressure, as investigators have recently reported in a pilot study involving elderly patients. This central pressure, which is directly linked to the cerebral micro-vascularization, can be easily measured by applanation tonometry. In this pilot study, investigators showed that a central pulse pressure equal or greater than 50 mmHg was associated with a significant frontal hypometabolism in elderly patients. This confirmed, at a stage of pre-clinical remodeling, the worse prognostic significance for this criterion, as reported in large epidemiological studies (increased risk of stroke and cardiac vascular events).

However, it is not yet known whether the level of central blood pressure interfere with the brain metabolism of younger subjects, especially with regard to aging observed throughout life. If this hypothesis is confirmed, preventive therapeutic strategies for accelerated aging, could thus integrate the monitoring of central pressure and cerebral metabolism.

Consequently, older adults store more body heat and experience greater elevations in core temperature during heat exposure at rest and during exercise. This maladaptive response occurs in adults as young as 40 years of age. Recently, heat acclimation associated with repeated bouts of exercise in the heat performed over 7 successive days has been shown to enhance whole-body heat loss in older adults, leading to a reduction in body heat storage. However, performing exercise in the heat may not be well tolerated or feasible for many older adults. Passive heat acclimation, such as the use of warm-water immersion may be an effective, alternative method to enhance heat-loss capacity in older adults. Thus, the following study aims to assess the effectiveness of a 7-day warm-water immersion (\~40°C) protocol in enhancing whole-body heat loss in older adults.

Its holistic approach and adaptability to individual needs make it an appealing option for individuals seeking sustainable improvements in physical and mental health. Thus, the integration and promotion of yoga as a therapeutic modality in health and wellness domains are warranted. Also, Nutrition plays a fundamental role in the health and well-being of individuals at all stages of life, but it is especially crucial in old age due to the physiological and metabolic changes that occur during the aging process. Maintaining a healthy and balanced diet is essential for providing the necessary nutrients for proper body function, strengthening the immune system, and maintaining the health of bone and cardiovascular structures. Specifically, the Mediterranean diet is a traditional dietary pattern based on foods commonly consumed in Mediterranean regions such as Greece, Italy, and Spain. It is characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish, and olive oil, along with moderate intake of dairy and red wine, and limited con-sumption of red meat and processed products. This eating style has been the subject of numerous scientific studies highlighting its multiple health benefits. Apart from the physical health benefits for older adults, the Mediterranean diet has consistently been associated with positive effects such as reduced risk of cardiovascular pathologies, de-creased chronic diseases and pro-inflammatory factors, as well as contributing to the prevention of obesity and cognitive decline.",Aging

Current evidence suggests a role for the FGF-Klotho system, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), miR-499, and exosomes not only in the pathophysiology of obesity, but also in the association with sarcopenic obesity (OS) and in a accelerated aging.

The investigator´s hypothesis is that obesity, especially OS, might be the cause of advanced aging, reflected in lower levels of the FGF-Klotho system, higher concentrations of cfDNA and a change in the profiles of miRNAs and exosomes, which could have an impact on risk. cardiovascular and metabolic.

For this, a descriptive cross-sectional study is proposed in 50 patients with obesity, who will be classified as OS or not, and 25 healthy controls, between 50-60 years old. The determinations are made by the IBIOMED of the University of León.

The investigators will use 1) continuous negative cuirass pressure, and 2) assisted biphasic cuirass ventilation to decrease obesity-related effects in older obese adults. Our approach will be to examine respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE with and without mechanical unloading in older obese men and women (65-75 yr), including those with respiratory symptoms (defined by a score of 1 or 2 on the modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale), as compared with older adults without obesity.

Specific Aims: The investigators will test the following hypotheses in older adults with and without obesity:

Aim 1) Obesity will decrease respiratory function but to a greater extent in older obese adults with respiratory symptoms, (as evidenced by altered pulmonary function and breathing mechanics at rest); Aim 2) Obesity will decrease exercise tolerance (as evidenced by peak V•O2 in ml/min/kg, i.e., physical fitness), but not cardiorespiratory fitness (as evidenced by peak V•O2 in % of predicted based on ideal body wt), except in older obese adults with respiratory symptoms where both may be reduced during graded cycle ergometry.

Aim 3) Obesity will increase DOE but to a greater extent in older obese adults with respiratory symptoms as evidenced by increased ratings of perceived breathlessness (sensory \& affective dimensions) during exercise.

Aim 4) Mechanical unloading of the thorax will improve respiratory function, submaximal exercise tolerance, and DOE in older obese adults, but to a greater extent in older obese adults with respiratory symptoms.","Obesity, Aging"

Underlying the physiological aspect of ageing, vitality capacity is reflected in the neuromuscular function, metabolism, and immune and stress response. The three domains seem to deteriorate with age, except among individuals who have maintained physical activity throughout their lives. Furthermore, immune cells, particularly T lymphocytes, appear to play a key role in each dimension of vitality capacity, as well as in the mice ageing pathway. Investigators sought to determine the effect of lifelong physical activity on vitality capacity, and especially on T cell metabolism.

In this optic, fourty healthy participants over the age of 55 will be allocated to two groups: 20 who have maintained physical activity for the past 30 years, and 20 who have not. Each participant's vitality capacity will be deeply tested and compared to their physical activity background.",Aging
